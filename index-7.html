The Work­shop will offer a common ground to colleagues from various disciplines and practice where they can meet, interact and exchange knowledge, experience, plans and ideas on how the digital revolution and modern information and communication technologies in general can or could be used and contribute to cartographic heritage in terms of acquisition, processing visualization and communication of relevant digital data.<br><br>Sessions: The sessions will basically follow the ICA Commission’s terms of reference:<br><ul>
<li>Introduce and establish the concept of "cartographic heritage". The multidisciplinary dimension of cartographic heritage.  </li>
<li>Transformation into digital form of old maps, globes and other cartographic documents. Comparison of digitization methods and technologies and development of relevant standards.</li>
<li>Applications of digital techniques to the cartographic study (analysis and interpretation) of old maps and their geometric and thematic content. Tests of various analytic processes and visualization.</li>
<li>Development and management of digital map libraries accessible to the general public. Digital tools to assist map curators, to aid the networking of map libraries and to allow in-situ and remote virtual access to cartographic heritage.</li>
<li>Digital support for the preservation and restoration of old maps, atlases and globes.</li>
<li>The use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and the web for the teaching and for the diffusion of the heritage of cartography and maps to the general public.</li>
<li>The ‘digital needs’ of individual map collectors.</li>
</ul>Papers: The papers, not exceeding 5.000 words, should be e-mailed by <span style="font-weight: bold;">April 10</span> for inclusion in the Workshop’s CD-ROM, which will be available to all participants.<br><br>Proceedings: The presented papers will be published in the proceedings of the Workshop. Some of the papers in a shorter version will be also published in the international web journal on sciences and technologies affined to history of cartography and maps <a href="http://www.e-perimetron.org/">e-Perimetron</a> [ISSN 1790-3769] following the journal’s editorial policy.<br><br>Language:  The presentations will be given in English as well as the papers sent for inclusion in the Workshop’s CD-ROM and in the Proceedings. Papers to be published in e-Perimetron can be also written in French according to the journal’s editorial policy.<br><br>Registration: Free.<br><br>Accommodation: Barcelona offers easy accessibility for own booking (travel + hotel packages) in great variety of alternatives. The organizers suggest the participants to plan by their own as early as possible their travel and staying.<br><br>Participation form: Please fill <a href="http://web.auth.gr/xeee/ICA-Heritage/Commission/3rd_Workshop/Registration_form_icc.doc">the participation form</a> [MSWord DOC] and <span style="font-weight: bold;">send it asap</span> to the contact e-mail addresses.

    <p>I'm really unclear on exactly how it is that "regular mowing along <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Parkway_%28Huntsville%29">Memorial Parkway</a>" makes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntsville,_Alabama">Huntsville</a> more "green". Are we talking about neatness, or environmental responsibility? <a href="http://www.al.com/news/huntsvilletimes/index.ssf?/base/news/1202811324275040.xml&amp;coll=1">The latest newspaper reporting</a> seems to confuse the two (or maybe it's the self-congratulatory civic leaders they're interviewing).<br><br>Now, planting trees, land preservation, picking up litter, preserves/parks, and curbside recycling are all reasonable indicia of green-ness. The work of <a href="http://conservation.alabama.gov/public-lands/stateLands/foreverWild/">Forever Wild</a>, the <a href="http://www.nature.org/wherewework/northamerica/states/alabama/">Nature Conservancy</a> and the <a href="http://www.landtrust-hsv.org/">Huntsville Land Trust</a> is truly laudable. And we shouldn't forget <a href="http://www.al.com/huntsvilletimes/stories/index.ssf?/base/news/1187256020161830.xml&amp;coll=1">the city's trail/greenway efforts</a>.<br><br>But someone needs to tell the mayor that mowing has a big carbon-and-air-quality footprint. Moreover, many would dispute the assertion that we have "good <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntsville,_Alabama#Public_transit">public transportation</a>". There's no bus or train feeders from rapidly-growing suburbia. The core shuttle-bus service is underused and under-promoted. No HOV lanes. Bad traffic snarl on almost every in-and-out-bound route during peak times (so lots of idling). No significant promotion of car pooling that I can see.<br><br>And let's not even talk about <a href="http://www.ghcc.msfc.nasa.gov/land/ncrst/ca.html">the monster sprawl out in the county</a> (e.g., drive Maysville Road between Maysville and Buckhorn sometime and tell me where those cotton fields and pastures are going, and where the inhabitants of those new houses are going to have to drive their SUVs in order to work, to eat, to shop). We can't call Huntsville "green" and ignore the massive changes going on in the hinterland just because it's a different jurisdiction -- it's all one big environmental system.<br><br>And there still has been no responsible grappling with water issues, despite the <a href="http://www.srh.noaa.gov/hun/productview.php?pil=esf&amp;sid=hun&amp;version=0">drought</a> and <a href="http://www.al.com/huntsvilletimes/stories/index.ssf?/base/news/1189329649234240.xml&amp;coll=1">good reporting in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Huntsville Times</span></a> and <a href="http://www.al.com/huntsvilletimes/stories/index.ssf?/base/news/1187169381211970.xml&amp;coll=1">on Alabama Public Television</a>, as well as <a href="http://blog.al.com/roop/2007/10/water_for_tomorrow.html">Lee Roop's wakeup calls</a> ... not to mention the widely publicized specter of electrical shortfalls this summer if <a href="http://climate.weather.com/articles/drought012408.html">the TVA can't cool all its reactors</a>.</p>

    <p>Last week, I posted a short bit on using <a href="http://www.gdal.org/ogr/ogrinfo.html">ogrinfo</a> and <a href="http://www.gdal.org/ogr/ogr2ogr.html">ogr2ogr</a> to <a href="http://horothesia.blogspot.com/2008/01/escape-from-pgeo.html">convert a layer in an ESRI personal geodatabase to a shapefile</a>. Today we'll automate the process with some python programming to extract all layers (regardless of geometry) from an arbitrary pgeo file.<br><br>The following examples assume you're running python within an <a href="http://fwtools.maptools.org/">FWTools</a> shell.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Get a list of layers</span><br><br>The first challenge is capturing the output from <span style="font-style: italic;">ogrinfo</span> (the list of layers) into a form we can parse. Python gives us a number of methods for issuing commands to the hosting system environment. The one to use here is <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/os-newstreams.html#l2h-2616">popen3 from the os module</a> since it will let us invoke <span style="font-style: italic;">ogrinfo</span> and then work with its output (specifically stdout) as a file-like object in code. We'll read the output lines into <a href="http://docs.python.org/tut/node5.html#SECTION005140000000000000000">a python list</a> for subsequent processing.<br></p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; import os<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; infilename = "ItAntMapping.mdb"<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; child_stdin, child_stdout, child_stderr = os.popen3("ogrinfo %s" % infilenam<br>e)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; output = child_stdout.readlines()<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; output<br>["INFO: Open of `ItAntMapping.mdb'\n", "      using driver `PGeo' successful.\n"<br>, '1: whollyimprecise\n', '2: placesAdded\n', '3: placesEstimated\n', '4: places<br>Solid\n', '5: stretchesDangling\n', '6: stretchesFloating\n', '7: stretchesSolid<br>\n', '8: tpPoints\n', '9: stretchesUnlocated\n']<br></pre>Now we want to cleanup this list of lines so we're left with a list of layer names (no prefixed numbers, no newline characters, no strings other than layer names). We'll iterate through each line in the output and, if a python regular expression designed to differentiate between layer names and <span style="font-style: italic;">ogrinfo</span>'s other outputs finds a match, we'll copy the relevant portion of the matched line into a new list of "layers". We'll need the python regular expression module (re) for this step.<br><br>In pseudocode:<br><ul>
<li>set up a regular expression to match a line that begins with a string of digits, a colon, and a space, followed by a string of arbitrary length and a newline (group the string that is the layer name)<br>
</li>
<li>create a new list to hold the layer names<br>
</li>
<li>for each line in the output list:<br><ul>
<li>attempt a regular expression match<br>
</li>
<li>if matched: append the contents of the group (the layer name) to the layers list</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>In python:<br><pre>import re<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; regex = re.compile('^\d+: (.*)\n')<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; layers = []<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; for line in output:<br>...     m = regex.match(line)<br>...     if m:<br>...         layers.append(m.groups()[0])<br>...<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; layers<br>['whollyimprecise', 'placesAdded', 'placesEstimated', 'placesSolid', 'stretchesD<br>angling', 'stretchesFloating', 'stretchesSolid', 'tpPoints', 'stretchesUnlocated<br>']<br></pre>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Extract each named layer</span><br><br>Now the easy part.

    <p>Last week, <a href="http://horothesia.blogspot.com/2008/01/growing-pains-at-bp3.html#gripe-rtl">I griped about blogger's announcement of right-to-left text support</a> because the post seemed to say that a point-and-click mechanism for mixing right-to-left and left-to-right text was only available in blogs set to the newly available Arabic, Hebrew or Persian languages.<br><br>I got a comment to the effect that I was wrong and that the settings are available in the dashboard. After an inspection of the dashboard for this blog, and of every single customization tab, I conclude that I was not wrong.<br><br>You can only get compose-gui support for mixing RTL and LTR in posts if your blog language is set to Arabic, Hebrew or Persian. <a href="http://help.blogger.com/bin/answer.py?answer=82229&amp;topic=12457">The relevant blogger help entry</a> confirms this view (emphasis mine):<br></p>
<blockquote>If you're not seeing the directionality buttons in the post editor, it's likely because <span style="font-weight: bold;">right-to-left support is only available in the Hebrew, Arabic and Persian interfaces.</span>
</blockquote>I stand by my original complaints.<br>

</ul>Contact: Mary Ruvane (Ruvane@email.unc.edu)<br><br>Real time contributory Web applications are fast becoming the de facto tool of choice for facilitating timely information exchange between various social groups.  Established examples include wikipedia, facebook, and flickr.  More recently applications for sharing geographic information have emerged, such as GoogleEarth and its companion Wikimapia, providing an unprecedented opportunity for historical researchers to collaborate on reconstructing past geographies.  But how trustworthy are these burgeoning websites?  Is the shared information accurate, in standard formats, well documented, or peer reviewed?  To be a viable tool in support of academic research these concerns must be addressed.<br><br>This session seeks speakers who have successfully adopted contributory GIS tools in support of their historical research or teaching.   Topics may include, but are not limited to:<br><ol>
<li>Projects utilizing contributory Historical GIS</li>
<li>Accuracy of geographic representations</li>
<li>Trustworthiness of shared data</li>
<li>Data standards solutions</li>
<li>Authenticating archival source material</li>
<li>Peer review/moderator solutions</li>
<li>Dealing with inferences</li>

    <p>I've been watching <a href="http://bpr3.org/">Bloggers for Peer-Reviewed Research Reporting</a> and their <a href="http://researchblogging.org/">Research Blogging aggregator</a> with interest since learning about it from <a href="http://archaeoastronomy.wordpress.com/">Alun Salt</a> last week. I was taken aback by today's announcement from Dave Munger that they are turning down applications "<a href="http://bpr3.org/">because the blogs aren't written in English</a>." My brain mumbled, "show-stopper." But I read on ...<br><br>I understand this problem: "The organization as it stands now simply doesn't possess the language skills to verify that blogs written in other languages are living up to our guidelines." Munger outlines some steps aimed at building community capability for handling non-English content. Since the BP3 model is predicated upon some human evaluation of a blog's "living up to [BP3] guidelines," they'll have to rise to the challenge or go out of business.<br><br>Another problem is poorly expressed: "readers might be turned off by a site that includes many posts written in a language they don't understand." How about (and this is clearly what Munger means if you read the whole post): users will need the ability to customize language and script settings. If I may, this will need to apply both to the interface, and to the filtering of content. And <span style="font-weight: bold;">please </span>don't bind these choices together! For example, I'd want an English-language interface but content in (at least) English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian and Spanish. This is one of the reasons we chose <a href="http://plone.org/">Plone</a> as the platform for <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/">Pleiades</a>: it comes localization-ready out of the box, and with a minimum of work you can manage multilingual content.<br><br>If the site hopes to mature beyond Anglophone scientific content, it's going to have to go multilingual.  There's a whole world of humanistic scholarship out there just waiting to go digital; and much of it is interestingly more than English.<br><br><span id="gripe-rtl">This</span> reminds me, I need to write a rant about Blogger's recently announced <a href="http://buzz.blogger.com/2008/01/three-new-languages-and-whole-new.html">pseudo-support for bidirectional text editing</a>. Hint: I can't embed right-to-left Arabic, Hebrew or Persian in this post, but if I were reset my blog's language settings to one of those languages then I could mix in left-to-right English (or whatever) here. I bet I'd have to manually hack the HTML to mark the "foreign" snippets for language and script per <a href="http://rfc.net/rfc4646.html">RFC4646</a> too ...</p>
