<p><strong>Proposal deadline: 31 May, 2018</strong></p>
<p>Today I noticed <a href="https://altegeschichte.philhist.unibas.ch/de/personen/sabine-huebner/">Sabine Huebner's</a> post to several lists with a call for papers for the following conference. Since only a PDF version of same is available via the website of <a href="https://altegeschichte.philhist.unibas.ch/de/forschung/forschungsprojekte/climate-science/">The Basel Climate Science and Ancient History Lab</a>, I thought I'd reproduce it in a more web-friendly format here. </p>
<p>Please direct any comments or questions to Professor Huebner at sabine.huebner@unibas.ch.</p>
<h3>Call for Papers</h3>
<h4>Climate Science and Ancient History:</h4>
<p>Decoding “Human” and “Natural” Archives<br>
Basel, Switzerland. Nov. 27-28, 2018</p>
<p>Ancient historians rely on “human archives” (historical narratives, inscriptions, coin hoards, papyrus archives, etc.) to reconstruct historic events, and social, economic, political and cultural systems among the Greeks, Romans and their neighbors. These historians are trained to read human archives with all their subjectivity and errors in recording and transmission. Palaeoclimatologists read and interpret “ natural archives” to assess changes in climatic and environmental conditions in the past. Palaeoclimate archives include organic (tree rings, corals) and inorganic materials (speleothems, lake and marine sediments, ice cores) and represent a treasure trove for accessing a whole new set of statistical and quantitative, usually highly resolved data of precisely dated information about past climate and environmental conditions. Natural archives also come with their inherent difficulties including qualitative and quantitative variations by region and period, temporal resolution, dating uncertainties, and climate information they resolve (temperature, precipitation, sunshine duration, drought, sea level changes, pH, sea water temperature, streamflow changes, etc.). </p>
<p>Not only are ancient historians and palaeoclimatologists often working on the same period and region, palaeoclimatologists also have to rely on historical documents as climate proxies for reconstructing climate in the past and need the help of historians for properly interpreting them. A closer collaboration between the two fields and a convergence of evidence from both disciplines will thus not only help to clarify the picture of past climates, but also widen our knowledge about the interaction between climate change, environmental stress, and socio-political systems. In recent years, a new discipline, coined “historical climatology”, has been established crossing the traditional division between historians and the natural sciences and combining their two approaches. Historical climatologists are studying the connectures between human and climate history, especially the impact of environmental change on past societies, and human resilience and mitigations strategies when faced with climate variability and climate change (cf. Izdebski et al. 2016; Haldon et al. 2018).</p>
<p>Switzerland has been at the forefront of climate research for the past few decades. “The Basel Climate Science and Ancient History Lab” is directing the focus on the impact of climate variability and climate change on societies in the ancient Mediterranean and in particular on the society of Graeco-Roman Egypt. Egypt in particular provides a unique historical laboratory in which to study social vulnerability and responses to climate and environmental change thanks to its extraordinarily rich evidence unparalleled for any other region of the ancient world.</p>
<p>In this colloquium we want to discuss the challenges connected to a joint interpretation of human and natural archives in the ancient Mediterranean, the problems inherent in a collaboration between ancient historians and the natural sciences (terminology, project design, publication culture), methods to solve discrepancies between information gained from the textual and archaeological evidence on the one hand and tree rings, ice cores and speleothems on the other one, the methodological difficulties in distinguishing between correlation and causality, and methods of assessing the impact of climatic variability or change on ancient societies without oversimplifying their causal connections. The impact of climate on past societies need to be assessed in a holistic venture, integrating and synthesizing traditional classical scholarship with the most advanced scientific methods in a manner which does not privilege data from one field over another.</p>
<p>The keynote lecture will be delivered by <a href="https://www.uni-giessen.de/faculties/f07/geography/sections/climate/staff/luterbacher">Jürg Luterbacher</a> (Giessen) on “Reconstructing Climate back to Greek and Roman Times: Challenges, Opportunities, and Uncertainties”.</p>
<p>Ancient historians and paleoclimatologists interested in starting a dialogue should send expressions of interest, along with short abstracts (not exceeding 300 words) to sabine.huebner@unibas.ch. Please include the full title of your talk and a brief biographical note on your academic affiliation and previous research. PhD candidates are encouraged to apply as well. The deadline for sending abstracts is May 31, 2018. </p>

<p>I'm currently hosting <em>paregorios.org</em> via GitHub pages, but I'm looking for an alternative because there are features I need that GitHub doesn't provide. Here, I think, is a description of my ideal solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apache web server with ability to use <code>.htaccess</code> files (because I want to be able to issue HTTP redirects)</li>
<li>SSL with Let's Encrypt</li>
<li>Deploy via ssh+rsync using ssh keys</li>
<li>Cost: less than $10/month</li>
</ul>
<p>I wonder where I will be able to find such a combination.</p>

    <p>Digital work in and around the Humanities often involves moving data from one system or format to another. That data often involves complex textual materials in multiple languages and writing systems. One commonly used format is the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">Comma-Separated Values</a>" text file. It's not uncommon to find that characters not used in English get garbled when exported from a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel to CSV (or imported from CSV into such a program). What's going on and how do you make it stop?<br></p>
<h3>Why</h3>CSV began life in an era before <a href="http://unicode.org/standard/WhatIsUnicode.html">Unicode</a> and, because of that background, some software assumes that CSV should be encoding using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">the ASCII text encoding scheme</a> (some older versions of Excel). Some software defaults to using ASCII, but you can override it manually (more recent versions of Excel). Some software tries to guess what encoding to use when reading or writing a given CSV file, but how it guesses may not be foolproof. Some software writes a special code called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark">Byte-Order Mark (BOM)</a> into the beginning of any CSV file that uses a Unicode-aware encoding (Excel for Mac 2016). Some software doesn't expect a BOM and will fail to read the data correctly even if the encoding (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8</a>) is otherwise supported.<br><h3>How to make it stop</h3>The best way to make it stop is to:<br><ol>
<li>Make sure that any CSV file you import or export is encoded in UTF-8 without a Byte-Order Mark.</li>
<li>Make sure that any software you're using is capable of reading and writing CSV files in UTF-8 without BOM and has been told to do so.</li>
</ol>Failing that (i.e., you got the CSV file from someone else), you need to find out what encoding it uses and configure your software to read it properly. But note that if the creator of the CSV file allowed it to be written in ASCII, it can't be repaired. You'll have to get them to re-export properly, or to send you the original file so you can open it in appropriate software and save it more deliberately.

    <p>This past summer, <a href="https://blogs.library.duke.edu/dcthree/">DC3</a>'s <a href="https://ryanfb.github.io/">Ryan Baumann</a> developed a reconciliation service for <i><a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/">Pleiades</a></i>. He's named it <i><a href="http://geocollider-sinatra.herokuapp.com/">Geocollider</a></i>. It has two manifestations:<br><br></p>
<ul>
<li>Upload <a href="https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000323.shtml">a CSV file</a> containing placenames and/or longitude/latitude coordinates, set matching parameters, and get back a CSV file of possible matches.</li>
<li>An online Application Programming Interface (API) compatible with the <i><a href="http://openrefine.org/">OpenRefine</a></i> data-cleaning tool.</li>
</ul>
<div>The first version is relatively self-documenting. This blog post is about using the second version with <i>OpenRefine</i>.</div>
<div><br></div>
<h3>Reconciliation</h3>
<div><br></div>
<div>I.e., matching (collating, aligning) your placenames against places in <i>Pleiades</i>.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Running <i>OpenRefine</i> against <i>Geocollider</i> for reconciliation purposes is as easy as:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://openrefine.org/download.html">Download and install <i>OpenRefine</i></a>.</li>
<li>Follow <a href="https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Reconciliation">the standard OpenRefine instructions for "Reconciliation,"</a> but instead of picking the pre-installed "Wikidata Reconciliation Service," select the "Add standard service..." button and enter "http://geocollider-sinatra.herokuapp.com/reconcile" in the service URL dialog, then select the "Add Service" button.</li>
</ul>
<div>When you've worked through the results of your reconciliation process and selected matches, <i>OpenRefine</i> will have added the corresponding <a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/help/what-are-pleiades-uris"><i>Pleiades</i> place URIs</a> to your dataset. That may be all you want or need (for example, if you're preparing to bring your own dataset into <a href="http://commons.pelagios.org/">the <i>Pelagios</i> network</a>) ... just export the results and go on with your work. </div>
</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>But if you'd like to actually get information <b>about</b> the <i>Pleiades</i> places, proceed to the next section.</div>
<div><br></div>
<h3>Augmentation</h3>
<div><br></div>
<div>I.e., pulling data from <i>Pleiades</i> into <i>OpenRefine</i> and selectively parsing it for information to add to your dataset.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>
<i>Pleiades</i> provides an API for retrieving information about each place resource it contains. One of the data formats this API provides is <a href="https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000381.shtml">JSON</a>, which is a format with which <i>OpenRefine</i> is designed to work. The following recipe demonstrates how to use the <a href="https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/General-Refine-Expression-Language">General Refine Expression Language</a> to extract the "Representative Location" associated with each <i>Pleiades</i> place. </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>
<span style="color: red;"><b>Caveat:</b></span> this recipe will not, at present, work with the current Mac OSX release of <i>OpenRefine</i> (2.7), even though it should and hopefully eventually will.  It has not been tested with the current releases for Windows and Linux, but they probably suffer from the same limitations as the OSX release. More information, including a non-trivial technical workaround, may be had from <a href="https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/1265">OpenRefine Issue 1265</a>. I will update this blog post if and when a resolution is forthcoming.</div>
<div><br></div>
<b>1. Create a new column containing <i>Pleiades</i> JSON. </b><br><div><br></div>

What's always been meant is "I will <b>make</b> those Mexicans pay for the wall. I will <b>make them pay.</b>" </span><br><span style='background-color: white; color: #1d2129; font-family: "San Francisco", -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, ".SFNSText-Regular", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; letter-spacing: -0.24px; white-space: pre-wrap;'><br></span><span style='background-color: white; color: #1d2129; font-family: "San Francisco", -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, ".SFNSText-Regular", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; letter-spacing: -0.24px; white-space: pre-wrap;'>So, the plan is surely trade sanctions and more. The real point of the whole thing will never be cost recovery (nor true border security). It's ritualized combat display: the leader publicly acting out his supposed manly vigor and strength of will by exercising the organs of state symbolically to humiliate, impoverish, emasculate, feminize, and punish a straw-man external enemy erected for the purpose. He will try to supplant the reality of the Mexican people's complex humanity, society, and shared-with-us economy with a fictionally puny, dirty, criminal, and base caricature. He will ostentatiously pummel that piñata in order to give the masses of his supporters a vicarious victory and a sham sense of security, a warm spatter of fake enemy blood, while his regime, less watched, loots our inheritance and undermines our liberties, doubling down on the very sorts of injustices that underlie the rage against government and establishment that helped put him in office in the first place.  </span>
