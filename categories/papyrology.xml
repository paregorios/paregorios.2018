The conference chairs: &lt;a href="http://www.lettere.uniroma1.it/users/silvia-orlandi"&gt;Silvia Orlandi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.antiquite.ens.fr/enseignants/permanences-et-contact/latin-126/article/francois-berard"&gt;Francois Berard&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.college-de-france.fr/site/en-john-scheid/#course"&gt;John Scheid&lt;/a&gt;. Members of the Steering Committee: &lt;a href="http://www.isti.cnr.it/about/people.php?id=69"&gt;Vittore Casarosa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://uni-heidelberg.academia.edu/PietroMariaLiuzzo"&gt;Pietro Liuzzo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://uniroma1.academia.edu/RaffaellaSantucci"&gt;Raffaella Santucci&lt;/a&gt;. The local organizing committee: Elizabeth Le Bunetel and Philippe Martineau. &lt;a href="http://www.eagle-network.eu/about/events/eagle2014/programme-committee/"&gt;Members of the EAGLE 2014 General Committee&lt;/a&gt; -- you are too numerous to mention, but no less appreciated. To the sponsors of &lt;a href="http://www.eagle-network.eu/"&gt;EAGLE Europeana&lt;/a&gt;: the &lt;a href="http://ec.europa.eu/cip/index_en.htm"&gt;Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.europeana.eu/"&gt;Europeana&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://wiki.wikimedia.it/wiki/Pagina_principale"&gt;Wikimedia Italia&lt;/a&gt;. To the presenters and poster-authors and their collaborators. To those who have made time out of busy schedules to prepare for, support, or attend this event. Colleagues and friends. Thank you for the invitation to speak and to be part of this important conference.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OK. Please get out your laptops and start up the &lt;a href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/"&gt;Oxygen XML Editor&lt;/a&gt;. If you actually read the syllabus for the course, you'd have already downloaded &lt;a href="http://www.stoa.org/epidoc/schema/latest/"&gt;the latest copy of the EpiDoc schema&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just kidding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have perhaps misled you with my title. This talk will not just be about &lt;a href="http://epidoc.sf.net/"&gt;EpiDoc&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, I'd like to use EpiDoc as an entrance point into some thoughts I've had about what we are doing here. About where we are going. I'd like to take EpiDoc as an example -- and the EAGLE 2014 Conference as a metaphor -- for something much larger: the whole disparate, polyvalent, heterarchical thing that we sometimes call "Épigraphie et électronique". Digital epigraphy. Res epigraphica digitalis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before we try to unpack how we got here and where we're going, I'd like to ask for your help in trying to illuminate who we are. I'd like you to join me in a little exercise in public self-identification. Not only is this an excellent way to help fill the generous block of time that the conference organizers have given me for this talk, it's also much less awkward than trooping out to the Place de la Sorbonne and doing trust falls on the edge of the fountain. ... Right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seriously. This conference brings together a range of people and projects that really have had no specific venue to meet, and so we are in some important ways unknown to each other. It's my hypothesis that, if we learn a bit about each other up front, we prime the pump of collaboration and exchange for the rest of the conference. After all, why do we travel to conferences at all if it is not for the richness of interacting with each other, both during sessions and outside them. OK, and as &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/chs/people/academic/roueche.aspx"&gt;Charlotte Roueché&lt;/a&gt; is ever vigilant to remind us, for the museums.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OK then, are you ready?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Independent of any formal position or any academic or professional credential, raise your hand if you would answer "yes" to this question: "Are you an epigraphist?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What about "are you an information scientist?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Historians?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, yes, you can be more than one of these -- you'll recall I rolled out the word "heterarchy" in my introduction!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How about "Wikipedian?" "Cultural Heritage Professional?" "Programmer?" "Philologist?" "Computer Scientist?" "Archivist?" "Museologist?" "Linguist?" "Archaeologist?" "Librarian?" "Physicist?" "Engineer?" "Journalist?" "Clergy?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Phooey! No clergy!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let's get at another distinction. How many of you would identify yourselves as teachers?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What about students?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Researchers? Administrators? Technicians? Interested lay persons?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OK, now that we have your arms warmed up, let's move on to voices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you can read, speak, or understand a reasonable amount of the English language, please join me in saying "I understand English."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ready? "I understand English."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OK. Now, if we can read, speak, or understand a reasonable amount of French, shall we say "Je comprends le français?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Je comprends le français."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What about Arabic?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bulgarian? Catalan? Flemish? German? Of course there are many more represented here, but I think you get my point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OK. Now let's build this rhetorical construct one step higher.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This one involves standing up if that's physically appropriate for you, so get yourselves ready! If cannot stand, by all means choose some other, more appropriate form of participation.&lt;br&gt;Independent of any formal position or any academic credential, I want you to stand up if you consider yourself a "scholar".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, please stay standing -- or join those standing -- if you consider yourself a "student".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, I did it. I reintroduced the word "student" from another category of our exercise. I am not only a champion of heterarchy, but also of recursive redefinition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And now, please stay standing -- or join those standing -- if you consider yourself an "enthusiast."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you're not standing, please stand if you can.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, pick out some one near you that you have not met. Shake their hand and introduce yourself. Ask them what they are so enthusiastic about that they were compelled to come to this conference!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alright. Please resume your seats.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think we're warmed up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let me encourage you to adopt a particular mindset while you are here at this conference. I hope that you will find it to be both amenable and familiar. It's the active recognition of the valuable traits we all share: intelligence, inquisitiveness, inventiveness, incisiveness, interdependence. Skill. Stamina. Uniqueness. Respect for the past. Congeniality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am here, in part, because I have a deep, inescapable interest in the study of ancient documents and in the application of computational methods and new media to their resurrection, preservation, and contemplation, and to their reintegration into the active cultural memory of the human people.&lt;br&gt;I have looked over &lt;a href="http://www.eagle-network.eu/about/events/eagle2014/agenda-programme/"&gt;the programme for this conference&lt;/a&gt;, and I have the distinct impression that your reasons for being here are somewhat similar to mine. I am delighted to have this opportunity to visit with old friends and fellow laborers. And to make the acquaintance of so many new ones. I expect to be dazzled by the &lt;a href="http://www.eagle-network.eu/about/events/eagle2014/digital-poster-exhibition/"&gt;posters&lt;/a&gt; and presentations to come. Are you as excited as I am?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My title did promise some EpiDoc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How many of you know EpiDoc?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How many of you know what EpiDoc is?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How many of you have heard of EpiDoc?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The word "EpiDoc" is a portmanteau, composed of the abbreviated word "epigraphy" and the abbreviated word "document" or "documentation" (I can't remember which). It has become a misnomer, as EpiDoc is used for much more than epigraphic documents and documentation. It has found &lt;a href="http://dh2011abstracts.stanford.edu/xtf/view?docId=tei/ab-193.xml;query=;brand=default"&gt;a home in papyrology&lt;/a&gt; and in the study of texts transmitted to us from antiquity via the literary and book-copying cultures of the intervening ages. It has at least informed, if not been directly used, in other allied subfields like numismatics and sigillography. It's quite possible I'll learn this week of even broader usages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EpiDoc is a digital format and method for the encoding of both transcribed and descriptive information about ancient texts and the objects that supported and transmitted them. Formally, it is a wholly conformant customization of the &lt;a href="http://www.tei-c.org/"&gt;Text Encoding Initiative&lt;/a&gt;'s standard for the representation of texts in digital form. It is serialized in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML"&gt;XML&lt;/a&gt; -- &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML"&gt;the Extensible Markup Language&lt;/a&gt; -- a specification developed and maintained by the &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/"&gt;World-Wide Web Consortium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EpiDoc is more than format and method. It is a community of practice. The term embraces all the people who learn, use, critique, and talk about EpiDoc. It also takes in the Guidelines, tools, and other helps that have been created and curated by those people. All of them are volunteers, scraping together the time to work on EpiDoc out of their personal time, their academic time, and out of the occasional grant. There has never been formal funding devoted to the development or maintenance of the EpiDoc guidelines or software. If you are a participant in the EpiDoc community, you are a hero.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EpiDoc was born in the late 1990s in a weird little room in the northwest corner of the third floor of &lt;a href="http://classics.unc.edu/departmental-history/murphey-hall-history/"&gt;Murphey Hall&lt;/a&gt; on the campus of the &lt;a href="http://unc.edu/"&gt;University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill&lt;/a&gt;. The room is no longer there. It was consumed in a much-needed and long-promised renovation in 2003 or so. It was the old &lt;a href="http://classics.unc.edu/"&gt;Classics Department&lt;/a&gt; computer lab: a narrow space with a sturdy, home-made, built-in counter along two walls and a derelict bookshelf. It was part of a suite of three rooms, the most spacious of which was normally granted as an office to that year's graduate fellow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The room had been appropriated by Classics graduate students &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/noelfiser"&gt;Noel Fiser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://philomousos.com/"&gt;Hugh Cayless&lt;/a&gt;, together with classical archaeology graduate student &lt;a href="http://www.classics.ucla.edu/people/faculty/kmcdonnell/"&gt;Kathryn McDonnell&lt;/a&gt;, and myself (an interloper from the &lt;a href="http://history.unc.edu/what-we-study/ancient-history/"&gt;History Department&lt;/a&gt;). The Classics department -- motivated and led by these graduate students with I-forget-which-faculty-member serving as figurehead -- had secured internal university funding to digitize the department's collection of 35 millimeter slides and build a website for searching and displaying the resulting images. They bought a server with part of the grant. It soon earned the name &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alecto"&gt;Alecto&lt;/a&gt; after one of the Furies in Greek mythology. I've searched in vain for a picture of the lab, which at some point we sponge-painted in bright colors evocative of the frescoes from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santorini#Minoan_Akrotiri"&gt;Minoan Santorini&lt;/a&gt;. The world-wide web was less than a decade old.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was unconscious then of the history of computing and the classics at Chapel Hill. To this day, I don't know if that suite of rooms had anything to do with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Woodley_Packard"&gt;David Packard&lt;/a&gt; and his time at Chapel Hill. At the &lt;a href="http://ciegl.classics.ox.ac.uk/"&gt;Epigraphic Congress in Oxford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://vivo.brown.edu/display/jbodel"&gt;John Bodel&lt;/a&gt; pointed to &lt;a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/294681"&gt;Packard's Livy concordance&lt;/a&gt; as one of the seminal moments in the history of computing and the classics, and thus the history of digital epigraphy. I'd like to think that we intersected that heritage not just in method, but in geography.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I had entered the graduate program in ancient history in the fall of 1995. I had what I would later come to understand to have been a spectacular slate of courses for my first term: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Talbert"&gt;Richard Talbert&lt;/a&gt; on the Roman Republic, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerzy_Linderski"&gt;Jerzy Linderski&lt;/a&gt; on Roman Law, and &lt;a href="http://classics.unc.edu/people/faculty-2/george-houston/"&gt;George Houston&lt;/a&gt; on Latin Epigraphy.&lt;br&gt;Epigraphy was new to me. I had seen and even tried my hand at reading the odd Latin or Greek inscription, but I had no knowledge of the history or methods of discipline, and very little skill. As George taught it, the Latin Epigraphy course was focused on the research use of the published apparatus of Latin epigraphy. The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_Inscriptionum_Latinarum"&gt;CIL&lt;/a&gt;. The journals. The regional and local corpora. What you could do with them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If I remember correctly, the &lt;a href="http://edh-www.adw.uni-heidelberg.de/home"&gt;Epigraphic Database Heidelberg&lt;/a&gt; was not yet online, nor were the &lt;a href="http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/"&gt;Packard Greek inscriptions&lt;/a&gt; (though you could search them on CDROM). Yes, the same Packard. Incidentally, I think we'll hear something very exciting about the Packard Greek Inscriptions in tomorrow's Linked Ancient World Data panel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, at some point I came across the early version of what is now called the &lt;a href="http://www.manfredclauss.de/"&gt;Epigraphische Datenbank Clauss - Slaby&lt;/a&gt;, which was online. Back then it was a simple search engine for digital transcripts of the texts in the &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L'Ann%C3%A9e_%C3%A9pigraphique"&gt;L'Annee Epigraphique&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; up from 1888 through 1993. Crucially, one could also download all the content in plain text files. If I understand it correctly, these texts were also destined for publication via the Heidelberg database (and eventually Rome too) after verification by autopsy or inspection of photographs or &lt;a href="http://blogs.cornell.edu/culconservation/2013/12/13/epigraphic-squeezes-part-i/"&gt;squeezes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At some point, I got interested in abbreviations. My paper for George's class was focused on "the epigraphy of water" in Roman North Africa. I kept running across abbreviations in the inscriptions that didn't appear in any of the otherwise helpful lists one finds in &lt;a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/8330250"&gt;Cagnat&lt;/a&gt; or one of the other handbooks.  In retrospect, the reasons are obvious: the handbook author tailors the list of abbreviations to the texts and types of texts featured in the handbook itself. Selected for importance and range, the statistical distribution of textual types and language, and of features like abbreviation, are not the same as those for the entire corpus. So, what is a former programmer to do? Why not download the texts from Clauss' site and write a program to hunt for parentheses. The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiden_Conventions"&gt;Leiden Conventions&lt;/a&gt; make parentheses a strong indicator of abbreviations that have been expanded by an editor, so the logic for the program seemed relatively straightforward.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mercifully, the hacktastical code that I wrote to do this task has, I think, perished from the face of the earth. The results, which I serialized into HTML form, &lt;a href="http://classics.case.edu/asgle/bookshelf/abbreviations-in-latin-inscriptions/"&gt;may still be consulted on the website of the American Society of Greek and Latin Epigraphy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As useful as the results were, I was dissatisfied with the experience. The programming language I had used -- called "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)"&gt;C&lt;/a&gt;" -- was not a very good fit for the kind of text processing involved. Moreover, as good as the Leiden Conventions are, parentheses are used for things other than abbreviations. So, there was manual post-processing to be done. And then there were the edge cases, like abbreviations that stand alone in one document, but are incorporated into longer abbreviations in others. And then there were expanded use cases: searching for text in one inscription that was abbreviated in another. Searching for abbreviations or other strings in text that was transcribed from the original, rather than in editorial supplement or restoration. And I wanted a format and software tools that was a better fit for textual data and this class of problems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;XML and the associated &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSL"&gt;Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL)&lt;/a&gt; -- both then fairly new -- seemed like a good alternative approach. So I found myself confronted with a choice: should I take XML and invent my own schema for epigraphic texts, or should I adopt and adapt something someone else had already created? This consideration -- to make or to take -- is still of critical importance not only for XML, but for any format specification or standards definition process. It's important too for most digital projects. What will you build and on what will you build it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are pros and cons. By adopting an existing standard or tool, you can realize a number of benefits. You don't reinvent the wheel. You build on the strengths and the lessons of others. You can discuss problems and approaches with others who are using the same method. You probably make it easier to share and exchange your tools and any data you create. It's possible that many of the logic problems that aren't obvious to you at the beginning have already been encountered by the pioneers.&lt;br&gt;But standards and specifications can also be walled gardens in which decisions and expert knowledge are hoarded by the founders or another elite group. They can undermine openness and innovation. They can present a significant learning curve. You can use a complex standard and find that you've built a submarine to cross the Seine. Something simpler might have worked better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Back then, there was a strong narrative around warning people off the cavalier creation of new XML schemas. The injunction was articulated in a harsh metaphor: "every time someone creates a new schema, a kitten dies." Behind this ugly metaphor was the recognition of another potential pitfall: building an empty cathedral. Your data format -- your personal or parochial specification -- might embody everything you imagined or needed, but be largely useless to, or unused by, anyone else.&lt;br&gt;So, being a cat lover, and being lazy (all the best programmers are lazy), I went looking for an existing schema. I found it in the Text Encoding Initiative. Whether the TEI (and EpiDoc) fit your particular use case is something only you can decide. For me, at that time and since, it was a good fit. I was particularly attracted to a core concept of the TEI: one should encode the intent behind the formatting and structure in a document -- the semantics of the authorial and editorial tasks -- rather than just the specifics of the formatting. So, where the Leiden Conventions would have us use parentheses to mark the editorial expansion of an abbreviation, the TEI gives us XML elements that mean "&lt;a href="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-abbr.html"&gt;abbreviation&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-expan.html"&gt;expansion&lt;/a&gt;." Where a modern Latin epigraphic edition would use a subscript dot to indicate that the identity of a character is ambiguous without reference to context, the TEI gives us the "&lt;a href="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-unclear.html"&gt;unclear&lt;/a&gt;" element.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This encoding approach pays off. I'll give just one example. For a few years now, I've been helping &lt;a href="http://www.efeo.fr/en/biographies/notices/griffiths.htm"&gt;Arlo Griffiths&lt;/a&gt; (who directs &lt;a href="http://www.efeo.fr/base.php?code=223"&gt;the Jakarta research center of the École française d'Extrême-Orient&lt;/a&gt;) to develop &lt;a href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/publications/inscriptions/campa/"&gt;a corpus of the surviving inscriptions of the Campa Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. This is a small corpus, perhaps 400 extant inscriptions, from coastal Vietnam, that includes texts in both Sanskrit and the incompletely understood Old Cam language. The script involved has not yet made its way into the &lt;a href="http://www.unicode.org/"&gt;Unicode&lt;/a&gt; specification. The standard transliteration scheme for this script, as well as some of the other editorial conventions used in the publication of Cam inscriptions, overlaps and conflicts with the Leiden conventions. But with TEI/EpiDoc there is no confusion or ambiguity. The XML says what the editor means to say, and the conventions of transcription are preserved unchanged, perhaps someday to be converted programmatically to Unicode when Unicode is ready.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EpiDoc transitioned from a personal project to a public one when another potential use case came along. For some time, a committee commissioned by the &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.aiegl.org/"&gt;Association Internationale d'Épigraphie Grecque et Latine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; had been working under the direction of &lt;a href="http://viaf.org/viaf/6103425"&gt;Silvio Panciera&lt;/a&gt;, then the chair of Latin epigraphy at La Sapienza in Rome. Their goal was to establish a comprehensive database of Greek and Latin inscriptions, primarily for the purpose of searching the texts and associated descriptive information or metadata. It was &lt;a href="http://www.queens.ox.ac.uk/academics/fellows/governing-body/charles-crowther/"&gt;Charles Crowther&lt;/a&gt; at Oxford's new &lt;a href="http://www.csad.ox.ac.uk/"&gt;Centre for the Study of Ancient Documents&lt;/a&gt; who put me in contact with the committee. And it was Charles who championed the eventual recommendation of the committee that the system they envisioned must be able to import and export structured documents governed by a standard schema. He was thinking of EpiDoc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many years have passed and many things have changed, and I'm forced to leave out the names of so many people whose hard work and acumen has brought about those changes. Here in Paris today Panciera's vision stands on the cusp of realization. It has also been transcended, for we are not here to talk about a standalone textual database or a federation of such, but about the incorporation of Greek and Latin epigraphy -- in all its historiographical variety and multiplicity of reception -- into the digital cultural heritage system of Europe (Europeana) and into the independent digital repository of a global people: Wikipedia and Wikidata. That EpiDoc can play a role in this grand project just blows me away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And it's not just about EAGLE, Europeana, Wikipedia, and EpiDoc. It's about a myriad other databases, websites, images, techniques, projects, technologies, and tools. It's about you and the work that you do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even as we congratulate ourselves on our achievements and the importance of our mission, I hope you'll let me encourage you to keep thinking forward. We are doing an increasingly good job of bringing computational approaches into many aspects of the scholarly communication process. But plenty remains to be done. We are starting to make the transition from using computer hardware and software to make conventional books and digital imitations thereof; "born digital" is starting to mean something more than narrative forms in PDF and HTML, designed to be read directly by each single human user and, through them, digested into whatever database, notebook, or other research support system that person uses. We are now publishing data that is increasingly designed for harvesting and analyzing by automated agents and that is increasingly less encumbered by outdated and obstructive intellectual property regimes. Over time, our colleagues will begin to spend less time seeking and ingesting data, and more time analyzing, interpreting, and communicating results. We are also lowering the barriers to appreciation and participation in global heritage by a growing and more connected and more vulnerable global people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will we succeed in this experiment? Will we succeed in helping to build a mature and responsible global culture in which heritage is treasured, difference is honored, and a deep common cause embraced and protected? Will we say three years from now that building that database or encoding those texts in EpiDoc was the right choice? In a century, will our work be accessible and relevant to our successors and descendants? In 5? In 10?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do not know. But I am thrilled, honored, and immensely encouraged to see you here, walking this ancient road and blazing this ambitious and hopeful new trail. This is our opportunity to help reunite the world's people and an important piece of their heritage. We are a force against the recasting of history into political rhetoric. We stand against the convenient ignorance of our past failures and their causes. We are the antidote to the destruction of ancient statues of the Buddha, to the burning of undocumented manuscripts, to papyri for sale on eBay, to fields of holes in satellite images where once there was an unexcavated ancient site.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let's do this thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description><category>conferences</category><category>digclass</category><category>eagle2014</category><category>epidoc</category><category>epigraphy</category><category>inscriptions</category><category>openness</category><category>papyrology</category><category>tei</category><category>walled gardens</category><category>xml</category><category>xslt</category><guid>http://paregorios.org/posts/2014/10/eighteen-years-of-epidoc-now-what/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2014 23:06:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Give Me the Zotero Item Keys!</title><link>http://paregorios.org/posts/2012/02/give-me-zotero-item-keys/</link><dc:creator>Tom Elliott</dc:creator><description>&lt;i&gt;I fear and hope that this post will cause someone smarter than me to pipe up and say UR DOIN IT WRONG ITZ EZ LYK DIS ...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Here's the use case:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &lt;a href="http://idp.atlantides.org/"&gt;Integrating Digital Papyrology project&lt;/a&gt; (and friends) have a &lt;a href="http://www.zotero.org/groups/papyrology"&gt;Zotero group library&lt;/a&gt; populated with 1,445 bibliographic records that were developed on the basis of an old, built-by-hand &lt;a href="http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/scriptorium/papyrus/texts/clist.html"&gt;Checklist of Editions of Greek and Latin Papyri (etc.)&lt;/a&gt;. A lot of checking and improving was done to the data in Zotero.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Separately, there's now a much larger pile of bibliographic records related to papyrology that were collected (on different criteria) by the &lt;a href="http://www.ulb.ac.be/philo/cpeg/bp.htm"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bibliographie Papyrologique&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; project. They have been machine-converted (into &lt;a href="http://www.tei-c.org/"&gt;TEI&lt;/a&gt; document fragments) from a &lt;i&gt;sui generis&lt;/i&gt; Filemaker Pro database and are now &lt;a href="http://papyri.info/bibliosearch"&gt;hosted via papyri.info&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://github.com/papyri/idp.data/tree/master/Biblio"&gt;the raw data is on github&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is considerable overlap between these two datasets, but also signifcant divergeance. We want to merge "matching" records in a carefully supervised way, making sure not to lose any of the extra goodness that BP adds to the data but taking full advantage of the corrections and improvements that were done to the Checklist data.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We started by doing an export-to-RDF of the Zotero data and, as a first step, that was banged up (programmatically) against the TEI data on the basis of titles. Probable matches were hand-checked and a resulting pairing of papyri.info bibliographic ID numbers against Zotero short titles was produced. You can see &lt;a href="http://idp.atlantides.org/biblio-matching/matches-2012-02.xml"&gt;the resulting XML here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;I should point out that almost everything up to here including the creation and improvement of the data, as well as anything below regarding the bibliography in papyri.info, is the work of others. Those others include Gabriel Bodard, Hugh Cayless, James Cowey, Carmen Lantz, Adam Prins, Josh Sosin, and Jen Thum. And the BP team. And probably others I'm forgetting at the moment or who have labored out of my sight. I erect this shambles of a lean-to on the shoulders of giants.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To guide the work of our bibliographic researchers in analyzing the matched records, I wanted to create an HTML file that looks like this:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: small;"&gt;Checklist Short Title = Papyri.info ID number and Full Title String&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: x-small;"&gt;BGU 10 = PI idno 7513: Papyrusurkunden aus ptolemäischer Zeit. (Ägyptische Urkunden aus den Staatlichen Museen zu Berlin. Griechische Urkunden. X. Band.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: x-small;"&gt;etc.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In that list, I wanted items to the left to be linked to the online view of the Zotero record at zotero.org and items on the right linked to the online view of the TEI record at papyri.info. The XML data we got from the initial match process provided the papyri.info bibliographic ID numbers, from which it's easy to construct the corresponding URIs, e.g., &lt;a href="http://papyri.info/biblio/7513"&gt;http://papyri.info/biblio/7513&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Zotero presented a problem. URIs for bibliographic records in Zotero server use alphanumeric "item keys" like this: CJ3WSG3S (as in &lt;a href="https://www.zotero.org/groups/papyrology/items/itemKey/CJ3WSG3S/"&gt;https://www.zotero.org/groups/papyrology/items/itemKey/CJ3WSG3S/&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;That item key string is not, to my knowledge, included in any of the export formats produced by the Zotero desktop client, nor is it surfaced in its interface (argh).&lt;/b&gt; It appears possible to hunt them down programmatically via the &lt;a href="http://www.zotero.org/support/dev/server_api/read_api"&gt;Zotero Read API&lt;/a&gt;, though I haven't tried it for reasons that will be explained shortly. It is certainly possible to hunt for them manually via the web interface, but I'm not going to try that for more than about 3 records.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;How I got the Zotero item keys&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, I have two choices at this point: write some code to automate hunting the item keys via the Zotero Read API or crack open the Zotero &lt;a href="http://www.sqlite.org/"&gt;SQLLite&lt;/a&gt; database on my local client and see if the item keys are lurking in there too. Since I'm on a newish laptop on which I hadn't yet installed &lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id448457090?mt=12"&gt;XCode&lt;/a&gt;, which seems to be a prerequisite to installing support for a &lt;a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0405/"&gt;Python virtual environment&lt;/a&gt;, which is the preferred way to get &lt;a href="http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html"&gt;pip&lt;/a&gt;, which is the preferred install prerequisite for &lt;a href="https://github.com/urschrei/pyzotero"&gt;pyzotero&lt;/a&gt;, which is the python wrapper for the Zotero API, I had to make some choices about which yaks to shave.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I decided to start the (notoriously slow) XCode download yak and then have a go at the SQLLite yak while that was going on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I grabbed the trial version of &lt;a href="http://www.razorsql.com/"&gt;RazorSQL&lt;/a&gt; (which looked like a good shortcut after a few minutes of Googling), made a copy of my Zotero database, and started poking around. I thought about looking for detailed documentation (&lt;a href="http://www.zotero.org/support/zotero_data"&gt;starting here I guess&lt;/a&gt;), but direct inspection started yielding results so I just kept going commando-style. It became clear at once that I wasn't going to find a single table containing my bibliographic entries. The Zotero client database is all normalized and modularized and stuff. So I viewed table columns and table contents as necessary and started building a SQL query to get at what I wanted. Here's what ultimately worked:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;pre style="background-color: #eeeeee; border: 1px dashed #999999; color: black; font-family: Andale Mono, Lucida Console, Monaco, fixed, monospace; font-size: 12px; line-height: 14px; overflow: auto; padding: 5px; width: 100%;"&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT itemDataValues.value, items.key FROM items &lt;br&gt;INNER JOIN libraries ON items.libraryID = libraries.libraryID&lt;br&gt;INNER JOIN groups ON libraries.libraryID = groups.libraryID&lt;br&gt;INNER JOIN itemData ON items.itemID = itemData.itemID&lt;br&gt;INNER JOIN itemDataValues ON itemData.valueID = itemDataValues.valueID&lt;br&gt;INNER JOIN fields ON itemData.fieldID = fields.fieldID&lt;br&gt;WHERE groups.name= "Papyrology" AND fields.fieldID=116&lt;br&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br&gt;The SELECT statement gets me two values for each match dredged up by the rest of the query: a value stored in the itemDataValues table and a key stored in the items table. The various JOINs are used to get us close to the specific value (i.e., a short title) that we want. 116 in the fieldID field of the fields table corresponds to the short title field you see in your Zotero client. I found that out by inspecting the fields table; I could have used more JOINs to be able to use the string "shortTitle" in my WHERE clause, but that would have just taken more time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The results of that query against my database looked like this:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;pre style="background-color: #eeeeee; border: 1px dashed #999999; color: black; font-family: Andale Mono, Lucida Console, Monaco, fixed, monospace; font-size: 12px; line-height: 14px; overflow: auto; padding: 5px; width: 100%;"&gt;&lt;code&gt;P.Cair.Preis.    2245UKTH&lt;br&gt;CPR 18           26K8TAJT&lt;br&gt;P.Bodm. 28       282XKDE9&lt;br&gt;P.Gebelen        29ETKPXC&lt;br&gt;O.Krok           2BBMS7NS&lt;br&gt;P.Carlsb. 5      2D2ZNT4C&lt;br&gt;P.Mich.Aphrod.   2DTD2NIZ&lt;br&gt;P.Carlsb. 9      2FWF6T6I&lt;br&gt;P.Col. 1         2G4CF756&lt;br&gt;P.Lond.Copt. 2   2GAEU5QP&lt;br&gt;P.Harr. 1        2GCCNGJV&lt;br&gt;O.Deir el-Bahari 2GH3FEA2&lt;br&gt;P.Harrauer       2H3T6EU2&lt;br&gt;(etc).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, copy that tabular result out of the RazorSQL GUI, paste it into a new &lt;a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/"&gt;LibreOffice&lt;/a&gt; spreadsheet and save it and I've got &lt;a href="http://idp.atlantides.org/biblio-matching/zdump-content.xml"&gt;an XML file&lt;/a&gt; that I can dip into from &lt;a href="http://idp.atlantides.org/biblio-matching/matches2html.xsl"&gt;the XSLT I had already started on&lt;/a&gt; to produce my HTML view.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://idp.atlantides.org/biblio-matching/matches-2012-02.html"&gt;Here's the resulting HTML file&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On we go.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Oh, and for those paying attention to such things, XCode finished downloading about two-thirds of the way through this process ...&lt;/i&gt;</description><category>bibliography</category><category>papyrology</category><category>tei</category><category>xml</category><category>xslt</category><category>yaks</category><category>zotero</category><guid>http://paregorios.org/posts/2012/02/give-me-zotero-item-keys/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 11 Feb 2012 04:04:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>New Blog: Digital Papyrology</title><link>http://paregorios.org/posts/2010/10/new-blog-digital-papyrology/</link><dc:creator>Tom Elliott</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Just started this morning: &lt;a href="http://digitalpapyrology.blogspot.com/"&gt;http://digitalpapyrology.blogspot.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>collaboration</category><category>dh</category><category>papyrology</category><guid>http://paregorios.org/posts/2010/10/new-blog-digital-papyrology/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 22 Oct 2010 19:02:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>A new Concordia term: "where" (needed for linking papyri to Pleiades resources)</title><link>http://paregorios.org/posts/2010/01/new-concordia-term-needed-for-linking/</link><dc:creator>Tom Elliott</dc:creator><description>&lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;In discussions this week with &lt;a href="http://sgillies.net/me"&gt;Sean&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://philomousos.blogspot.com/"&gt;Hugh&lt;/a&gt;, we explored what would be minimally necessary for web feeds describing the papyrological documents now being surfaced via &lt;a href="http://papyri.info"&gt;http://papyri.info&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the long term, we'd like to link not only to descriptive resources (at &lt;a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org"&gt;Pleiades&lt;/a&gt; or elsewhere) for their modern places of finding but also any ancient places attested in the texts themselves (having done named-entity analysis on all 50,000+ documents, the first steps in which are now underway by &lt;a href="http://www.kuleuven.be/cv/u0009750e.htm"&gt;Mark Depauw&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.trismegistos.org/"&gt;Trismegistos&lt;/a&gt; team in Leiden).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the near term, we can express geographic linkages on the basis of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nome_%28Egypt%29"&gt;nome&lt;/a&gt; attributions recorded for the papyri by the editors of the &lt;a style="font-style: italic;" xml:lang="de" title="Heidelberg Register of Greek Papyri from Egypt" href="http://www.rzuser.uni-heidelberg.de/%7Egv0/"&gt;Heidelberger Gesamtverzeichnis der griechischen Papyrusurkunden Ägyptens&lt;/a&gt; whose records are incorporated into the papyri.info contents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But none of the terms we had previously defined in our &lt;a href="http://atlantides.org/trac/concordia/wiki/ConcordiaThesaurus"&gt;Concordia link-type thesaurus&lt;/a&gt; precisely fit this information. We did have several geographic terms (findSpot, origin, observedAt and attestsTo), but we needed to add a more generic one: "where". The nomes as indicated by HGV are geographical classifications, based on the ancient regions, made primarily for facilitating reference and review by modern scholars. They don't necessarily constitute "find spot" or "place of origin" in every case.  This "where" term idea followed naturally from &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/where-link-relation-type/"&gt;Sean's earlier efforts&lt;/a&gt; to advocate for a "where" link relation type. A link in a feed entry using this term will simply indicate that the described resource should be treated as being located, in a general way, at the place described by the linked resource.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hopefully, this term will be useful not only for papyri.info, but also for other pre-existing datasets where the location information recorded about ancient artifacts is similarly less precise than the born-digital epigraphic corpora that guided the minting of our initial thesaurus terms. Hopefully it will also prove useful in &lt;a href="http://mediterraneanceramics.blogspot.com/2010/01/rdfa-patterns-for-ancient-world.html"&gt;contexts&lt;/a&gt; such as those that &lt;a href="http://sebastianheath.com/"&gt;Sebastian&lt;/a&gt; has recently been blogging about.&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>concordia</category><category>epigraphy</category><category>feeds</category><category>gawd</category><category>papyrology</category><category>pleiades</category><guid>http://paregorios.org/posts/2010/01/new-concordia-term-needed-for-linking/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 30 Jan 2010 05:46:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Bridging Institutional Repository and Bibliographic Management</title><link>http://paregorios.org/posts/2009/11/bridging-institutional-repository-and/</link><dc:creator>Tom Elliott</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;As an institution, &lt;a href="http://www.nyu.edu/isaw/"&gt;ISAW&lt;/a&gt; has an interest in disseminating, preserving and promoting the research products and publications of its faculty, research staff, students, affiliates and collaborators. Our parent institution, &lt;a href="http://www.nyu.edu"&gt;NYU&lt;/a&gt;, has made a commitment to the persistent dissemination of such materials when voluntarily contributed to its &lt;a href="http://archive.nyu.edu/"&gt;Faculty Digital Archive (FDA)&lt;/a&gt;. We'll use the FDA as a locus for materials that fit well into &lt;a href="http://www.dspace.org/"&gt;DSpace&lt;/a&gt; (with which the FDA is realized) and that aren't rights-constrained. But we also need mechanisms for developing and publishing the whole bibliographic story of a particular faculty member, research group, project or conference with links from the individual entries to digital copies wherever they may be (e.g., the FDA, &lt;a href="http://www.jstor.org/"&gt;JSTOR&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.archive.org/"&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/"&gt;Google Books&lt;/a&gt;). For this function, we like &lt;a href="http://www.zotero.org/"&gt;Zotero&lt;/a&gt;. Atop &lt;a href="http://www.zotero.org/blog/follow-libraries-and-collections-with-feeds/"&gt;Zotero's robust and ubiquitous feed documents&lt;/a&gt;, we can build interoperability with our website and other tools and venues in a way that is also completely visible to commercial and third-party search and discovery tools.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There will be a number of iterations necessary to reach a fully robust solution, but we're already taking some of the first steps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As an early experiment with the FDA, we had a student assistant input all of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_S._Bagnall"&gt;my boss&lt;/a&gt;'s articles in PDF format, along with descriptive metadata (see: &lt;a href="http://archive.nyu.edu/handle/2451/28115"&gt;Roger Bagnall's Publications&lt;/a&gt;). The default metadata schema in the FDA wasn't a perfect fit for journal article citations, but the FDA staff is now working with us to extend the schema to meet our needs.  We're using the Zotero data model as a guide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Given that the metadata in this collection is the only structured dataset around for Roger's articles, I wanted to be able to get it all back out to use for other things. The FDA does provide web feeds, but (unlike Zotero) these aren't comprehensive for a given context and don't incorporate all the metadata fields. But we can use FDA's &lt;a href="http://www.openarchives.org/pmh/"&gt;OAI-PMH&lt;/a&gt; interface to get the full metadata with a query like:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://archive.nyu.edu/request?verb=ListRecords&amp;amp;metadataPrefix=oai_dc&amp;amp;set=hdl_2451_28115"&gt;http://archive.nyu.edu/request?verb=ListRecords&amp;amp;metadataPrefix=oai_dc&amp;amp;set=hdl_2451_28115&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;where "hdl_2451_28115" is the identifier for the "Roger Bagnall's Publications" container I linked to above. (Special thanks to Ekaterina Pechekhonova on the NYU Digital Library team, who helped me with syntax).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a further experiment, I wrote an &lt;a href="http://homepages.nyu.edu/%7Ete20/examples/fda-zotero/fdaoai2zoterordf.xsl"&gt;XSL transform to convert the OAI-PMH XML&lt;/a&gt; document into the &lt;a href="http://homepages.nyu.edu/%7Ete20/examples/fda-zotero/bagnall-fda.rdf"&gt;RDF XML Zotero can import&lt;/a&gt;. There are a couple of inelegant hacks in the transform (mainly to get at substrings within single fields), but I'm still happy with the results. The import into Zotero went smoothly:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.zotero.org/paregorios/items/collection/1505597"&gt;http://www.zotero.org/paregorios/items/collection/1505597&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Next steps: move this to a shared Zotero library so Roger, a student assistant and members of our digital projects team can collaborate to enter the rest of the publications (books, book sections, etc.) and fix any errors in the article records. Then we'll look at the process for using that metadata (via another transform) to help us populate the FDA. We'll also start working on parsing and aggregating Zotero's feeds for use on our website (in Roger's online profile and aggregated with other affiliates' feeds to provide a "recent publications" section).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We're also experimenting with Zotero for the &lt;a href="http://www.zotero.org/groups/pleiades"&gt;bibliography of our Pleiades project&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/"&gt;collaborative online gazetteer of the Greek and Roman world&lt;/a&gt;), and as a component in a potential replacement for the &lt;a href="http://scriptorium.lib.duke.edu/papyrus/texts/clist.html"&gt;Checklist of Editions of Greek, Latin, Demotic and Coptic Papyri, Ostraca and Tablets&lt;/a&gt;. On a more personal level, I've taken to doing all my bookmarking with Zotero and have set up &lt;a href="http://www.zotero.org/paregorios/items/collection/1299262"&gt;a folder in my library&lt;/a&gt; (with associated feed) so that colleagues can following what I'm citing on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>bibliography</category><category>dspace</category><category>fda</category><category>interop</category><category>isaw</category><category>papyrology</category><category>pleiades</category><category>publications</category><category>tools</category><category>zotero</category><guid>http://paregorios.org/posts/2009/11/bridging-institutional-repository-and/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 19 Nov 2009 21:27:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>DM The Book Ex</title><link>http://paregorios.org/posts/2009/01/dm-book-ex/</link><dc:creator>Tom Elliott</dc:creator><description>&lt;a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/pjones/"&gt;Paul Jones&lt;/a&gt; posted at Facebook a link to this notice from &lt;a href="http://www.bullcityrising.com/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bull City Rising&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: "&lt;a href="http://www.bullcityrising.com/2009/01/the-book-exchange-to-shutter-in-february-after-75-years.html"&gt;The Book Exchange to shutter in February after 75 years&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;amp;hs=t4s&amp;amp;um=1&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;q=the+book+exchange+durham&amp;amp;fb=1&amp;amp;split=1&amp;amp;gl=us&amp;amp;view=text&amp;amp;latlng=15604156247268618568#"&gt;The Book Ex&lt;/a&gt; (in Durham, North Carolina) wasn't just for Law School students.

Our two workshops (and lots of discussion with other parties in between) have led us through &lt;a href="http://horothesia.blogspot.com/2007/09/feeds-for-pleiades-data.html"&gt;KML&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://horothesia.blogspot.com/2008/02/atomgeorss-for-interoperability.html"&gt;Atom+GeoRSS&lt;/a&gt;, citation vocabularies and &lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/groups/profile?show=more&amp;amp;enc_user=3woajxYAAADz2Iah2CYKpGhWfIfANf6qo4cocwWvDVg2RHsu8f1bCg&amp;amp;group=oai-ore"&gt;OAI/ORE&lt;/a&gt; on to &lt;a href="http://horothesia.blogspot.com/search/label/batlasids"&gt;Cool URIs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://sgillies.net/blog/785/linking-open-geographic-data/"&gt;Linked Data&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://sgillies.net/blog/849/why-not-cidoc-crm-at-this-time/"&gt;CIDOC CRM&lt;/a&gt; and more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Traffic is now building on the &lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/gawd"&gt;Graph of Ancient World Data discussion group&lt;/a&gt; (e.g., &lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/gawd/browse_thread/thread/226f0e5f6fb64237"&gt;Sebastian Heath's post on coin hoard data&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="http://nomisma.org/"&gt;nomisma.org&lt;/a&gt;). Yesterday, &lt;a href="http://sgillies.net/me"&gt;Sean Gillies&lt;/a&gt; rolled out &lt;a href="http://www.atlantides.org/trac/pleiades/changeset/1445"&gt;some changes to the Pleiades interface&lt;/a&gt; that provide &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/cooluris/#hashuri"&gt;#this endpoints&lt;/a&gt; for Pleiades places, so that Sebastian and others can make explicit reference either to the historical places themselves (non-information resources cited like &lt;a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/639166#this"&gt;http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/639166#this&lt;/a&gt;) or our descriptions of them on the web (information resources, cited like &lt;a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/639166/"&gt;http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/639166/&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then this afternoon I came across the latest Talis Semantic Web podcast, featuring &lt;a href="http://blogs.talis.com/nodalities/2009/01/koven-smith-talks-about-the-semantic-web-and-museums.php"&gt;Koven Smith on Semantic Web initiatives at the Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;/a&gt;. 38 minutes well-spent. They're thinking about and exploring a number of the approaches and technologies we're interested in, but from a museum perspective. It would be interesting to discuss how these methods could be used to better bridge gaps between museums, field archaeologists, epigraphers, numismatists, papyrologists, prosopographers, historical geographers, librarians, archivists and the rest!&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>ancgeo</category><category>batlasids</category><category>concordia</category><category>epigraphy</category><category>interop</category><category>papyrology</category><category>patterns</category><category>pleiades</category><category>prosopography</category><guid>http://paregorios.org/posts/2009/01/semantic-web-scholarly-resources-for/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2009 01:08:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Digital Projects (ISAW Newsletter January 2008)</title><link>http://paregorios.org/posts/2009/01/digital-projects-isaw-newsletter/</link><dc:creator>Tom Elliott</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Since the &lt;a href="http://horothesia.blogspot.com/2009/01/isaw-newsletter-january-2008.html"&gt;ISAW Newsletter&lt;/a&gt; is only available online as a monolithic PDF, I thought I'd make the text of my contribution (about our "digital programs") available here in HTML form:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;ISAW’s digital programs are fundamental to the Institute’s mission. Convinced that the transformation of the media and information landscape now underway offers scholars unparalleled opportunities to make new discoveries, collaborate with distant colleagues, engage public interests, and tackle previously intractable problems, we have committed ourselves to an ambitious slate of digital initiatives that extend far beyond the walls of the Institute. As the examples below illustrate, we emphasize the creation and delivery of core resources such as primary and secondary texts and images, as well as geographic and archaeological reference information. We seek to serve the entire field of ancient studies by working for the durability of digital publications–and the sustainability of the projects that create and maintain them–through promotion of standards, creation of reusable free software, use of open-access licenses, and decentralization of authorial, editorial, and peer-review activities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In early 2008, ISAW became a partner in the &lt;a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/"&gt;Pleiades Project&lt;/a&gt;. Together with the &lt;a href="http://www.unc.edu/awmc/"&gt;Ancient World Mapping Center&lt;/a&gt; (AWMC), we are digitizing the most comprehensive register of geographical data for the ancient Greek and Roman world, collected by the &lt;a href="http://www.apaclassics.org/"&gt;American Philological Association&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href="http://www.unc.edu/depts/cl_atlas/"&gt;Classical Atlas Project&lt;/a&gt; to support the preparation of the &lt;a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43970336"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (R. Talbert, ed., Princeton 2000). All of the coordinates, historical names, and other information in this rich collection are being placed online so scholars, students, and enthusiasts worldwide can browse, search, and map it, as well as offer suggestions for updates and additions. The Pleiades effort has recently expanded with funding from a Transatlantic Digitization Grant, awarded to ISAW and King’s College London, by the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and the U.K. Joint Information Systems Committee. It supports the prototyping of mechanisms to tie Pleiades into important digital collections of epigraphic and papyrological texts from Egypt and coastal North Africa (see further: the &lt;a href="http://concordia.atlantides.org/"&gt;Concordia Project&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/gawd"&gt;Graph of Ancient World Data&lt;/a&gt; group). This effort will lay the foundation for extensive, automated cross-linking between Pleiades and other web-based scholarly resources for the entire Greek and Roman world. We are currently seeking funding for a second, two-year development period for Pleiades/Concordia that will accelerate the digitization of content and bring users together for a series of workshops to identify needed improvements to the system and to facilitate more effective collaboration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past year ISAW has also assumed a leadership role in a group of interrelated digital papyrology projects (see &lt;a href="http://idp.atlantides.org/"&gt;http://idp.atlantides.org&lt;/a&gt;). One of these, funded by a grant to Duke University from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, has successfully upgraded and effectively integrated two of the key digital resources for study of ancient documents on papyrus: the &lt;a href="http://idp.atlantides.org/trac/idp/wiki/DDBDP"&gt;Duke Databank of Documentary Papyri&lt;/a&gt; (DDbDP) and the &lt;a href="http://idp.atlantides.org/trac/idp/wiki/HGV"&gt;Heidelberger Gesamtverzeichnis der griechischen Papyrusurkunden Ägyptens&lt;/a&gt; (HGV). Both resources will soon be provided to users via a search and display environment prototyped by the digital libraries team at Columbia University. This system, dubbed the &lt;a href="http://papyri.info/"&gt;Papyrological Navigator&lt;/a&gt;, combines DDbDP and HGV content with images and database records drawn from the 22 museum and university papyrus collections that constitute the &lt;a href="http://idp.atlantides.org/trac/idp/wiki/APIS"&gt;Advanced Papyrological Information System&lt;/a&gt; (APIS). It also links them to the extensive &lt;a href="http://www.trismegistos.org/"&gt;Trismegistos&lt;/a&gt; databases in Leuven. Under new funding provided to APIS by the NEH, work on this interface will move to the Digital Libraries team at NYU where, with collaboration from ISAW and APIS team members at Columbia, it will see extensive improvements. ISAW is currently working with partners to secure funding for a second major upgrade to the DDbDP and HGV: a collaborative, online editing environment that will speed the addition and revision of content by granting papyrologists worldwide direct authorial capabilities under a distributed system of editorial oversight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A number of other exciting projects are in work for 2009 and beyond. We hope to expand the utility of Pleiades by linking it to a number of other systems and digital gazetteers under development at a variety of institutions around the world. Plans are being formulated for a collaborative digital encyclopedia of Coptic archaeology, an extensive database of digital images, an online calendar of museum exhibitions, a major book and journal digitization program, and a multi-institutional publication series comprising open-access primary texts and research data.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><category>batlas</category><category>concordia</category><category>gawd</category><category>isaw</category><category>papyrology</category><category>pleiades</category><category>rights</category><guid>http://paregorios.org/posts/2009/01/digital-projects-isaw-newsletter/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2009 21:33:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Pinakes: Greek texts and manuscripts</title><link>http://paregorios.org/posts/2008/09/pinakes-greek-texts-and-manuscripts/</link><dc:creator>Tom Elliott</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Post by Arietta Papaconstantinou noted just now on the &lt;a href="http://www.listserv.hum.ku.dk/archives/papy.html"&gt;papy list&lt;/a&gt; (closed archive, sorry, so no link to original message):&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Pinakes: Greek texts and manuscripts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://pinakes.irht.cnrs.fr"&gt;http://pinakes.irht.cnrs.fr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Institut de recherche et d’histoire des textes (CNRS, Paris) is happy to announce that the Pinakes database (formerly Greek Index Project) is now available for consultation in a free web version.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The database lists the manuscripts of Greek works written prior to A.D. 1600, for the most part recorded in printed catalogues of manuscripts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The current version of Pinakes includes 200,000 entries.
