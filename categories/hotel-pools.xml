The pool at the &lt;a href="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/phldt-philadelphia-marriott-downtown/"&gt;Philadelphia Marriott Downtown&lt;/a&gt; is an exception.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This past week I found the indoor 7th floor pool to be adequate and well maintained. Basically a lap pool (2 lanes wide) roughly 25 yards in length (North American winter short course), with a square lounge/play area off to one side. No lane ropes. Bottom lane marks, but none at ends. Ranging 3.5 - 4.5 feet deep. A newish looking vinyl liner. The water was clear, and tasted vaguely of salt (I guess they're using the new-fangled chemicals -- Ph was good). Open 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. I think. Changing rooms with showers adjacent, as well as a larger-than-average workout room with treadmills and so forth. Access with room cardkey.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>horothesia</category><category>hotel pools</category><guid>http://paregorios.org/posts/2009/01/hotel-pools-suitable-for-lap-swim/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2009 21:41:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
