It's called "&lt;a href="http://classics.buffalo.edu/events/dcaconference/"&gt;Word, Space, Time: Digital Perscpectives on the Classical World&lt;/a&gt;" and runs today and tomorrow (5-6 April 2013) in the Center for the Arts Screening Room at the University of Buffalo. On-site registration is available, so come on out!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://classics.buffalo.edu/events/dcaconference/program.shtml"&gt;Here's the conference program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's already broad consensus that we'll use the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23dca2013"&gt;#dca2013&lt;/a&gt; hashtag for tweets about the event. If you're blogging or otherwise serializing or critiquing the conference online and your platform is feed-equipped, please let me know and I'll make sure it's in the subscription list for the &lt;a href="http://planet.atlantides.org/maia/"&gt;Maia Atlantis feed aggregator&lt;/a&gt; so it gets wider exposure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've also initiated an IRC channel on the freenode network to support backchannel communications: #dca2013.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here's hoping for robust wifi at the venue...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See you at the conference or online!&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>atlantis</category><category>blogs</category><category>coffee</category><category>conferences</category><category>dca2013</category><category>digclass</category><category>feeds</category><category>horothesia</category><guid>https://paregorios.org/posts/2013/04/digital-classics-association-conference/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2013 16:52:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Coffee in Huntsville: Sam and Greg's</title><link>https://paregorios.org/posts/2009/01/coffee-in-huntsville-sam-and-gregs/</link><dc:creator>Tom Elliott</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I finally made good on my long-standing intention to drop in at &lt;a href="http://www.samandgregs.com/"&gt;Sam and Greg's Pizzeria/Gelateria&lt;/a&gt; on the north side of the square in downtown Huntsville today (&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;q=119+North+Side+Square,+Huntsville,+AL&amp;amp;fb=1&amp;amp;split=1&amp;amp;cid=0,0,10114298661214155859&amp;amp;ll=34.73142,-86.585183&amp;amp;spn=0.00947,0.022745&amp;amp;z=16&amp;amp;iwloc=A"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt;).

The owners just sent the following note to &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#/pages/Huntsville-AL/Stearns-Coffee/7362583473"&gt;their Facebook&lt;/a&gt; followers:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;So as many of you have probably guessed or assumed by now, Stearns Coffee will be unable to re-open. After carefully considering all of our options, we’ve found that we just can’t rebound financially from this. With that said, we are truly lucky to have so many customers and friends who have offered their love and support. We are so grateful to have had the opportunity to serve these people; you are what made our shop such a wonderful place to be. We will miss seeing your faces and allowing us to be a part of your lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Daniel &amp;amp; Marisa&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><category>coffee</category><category>horothesia</category><category>hsv</category><guid>https://paregorios.org/posts/2009/01/stearns-coffee-defunct/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2009 21:49:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Relax-o-matic</title><link>https://paregorios.org/posts/2009/01/relax-o-matic/</link><dc:creator>Tom Elliott</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;So, in the monthly email newsletter on healthy living that I receive gratis from my beneficent employer, I read:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Find Yourself in the Stressed Lane?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When you find you need to take a moment to relax and slow down, contact The Relaxation Phone Line at &lt;snip&gt;[...]. This line is a recorded relaxation message that provides you with an opportunity to unwind and renew for a few minutes during your day. The Relaxation Phone Line is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.&lt;/snip&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Huh.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is there also a Relaxation Blog (with a relax-o-feed)?
