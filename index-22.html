    <i>2009-2010 Visiting Research Scholar Lecture Series<br>The <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/isaw/">Institute for the Study of the Ancient World</a>, NYU</i><br><br><b>The Temple of Osiris in Abydos during the Late Period</b><br>Presented by: David Klotz, Visiting Research Scholar<br><br>Although the city of Abydos was one of the most important religious centers of Egypt from the Predynastic  Period through the New Kingdom, little remains of its monuments from the Late Period (c. 1000-300 BC).  In the early twentieth century, W.F. Petrie discovered meager traces of an Osiris temple dating to the reign of Amasis (Twenty-Sixth Dynasty, c. 570-526 BC), and recent New York University excavations have uncovered another temple built by Nectanebo I and II (Thirtieth Dynasty, c. 378-341 BC). Nonetheless, the intervening period - the era of Persian domination - remains a mystery, and the earlier temple of Amasis seems to have completely vanished.<br><br>Two new sources provide valuable information on this obscure chapter in the history of Abydos.  The first  is a statue in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (MMA 1996.91) belonging to a prominent Egyptian general from the Thirtieth Dynasty.  This object includes a difficult autobiographical inscription text in which the owner narrates how he defended Egypt from invading Persian armies and restored massive damage inflicted upon Abydos. At Sohag, meanwhile, the church of St. Shenoute at the White Monastery (c.450 AD) incorporates Pharaonic and Graeco-Roman spolia reused from earlier monuments.  The Yale White Monastery Church Documentation Project (2007-2009) recorded over twenty granite blocks from the reign of Amasis, and the decoration indicates they derive from the Osiris temple at Abydos.<br><br>The archaeological and epigraphic record suggests the Osiris temple was badly damaged - if not completely destroyed - during the period of Achaemenid rule in Egypt.  Similar accounts of Persian looting are attested at multiple Egyptian sites, but they are often dismissed as mere propaganda intended to legitimize the subsequent Ptolemaic dynasty.  The case of Abydos leads us to reevaluate our assumptions concerning the religious policies of the Great Kings of Persia.<br><br>Date: Tuesday, October 20th<br>Time: 6:00pm<br>Location: Lecture Hall<br>The Institute for the Study of the Ancient World<br>15 East 84th St.<br>New York, NY  10028<br>212-992-7843<br>isaw@nyu.edu<br><br><i>*This event is free and open to the public </i>

By examining examples of the full available range of ancient linguistic evidence, and drawing on sociolinguistic theory about multilingualism and diglossia, this thesis will be challenged, and a more complex pattern of language usage will be sketched out. The consequences of this for issues of local identity and culture will then be explored.<br><br>David Taylor is the University Lecturer in Aramaic and Syriac at the University of Oxford, and during 2009-2010 he is a Visiting Research Scholar at the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, NYU.<br><br>The next lecture of the series will be given by David Klotz on October 20th.

Whereas the chronological and formal developments of each regional tradition remain an important research goal, this conference encourages comparative observations and interpretations of ancient sarcophagi in broader geo-cultural spheres and more specific ritual/religious contexts. It is hoped that by addressing these two research objectives simultaneously, this conference will help open new ways to think about the development of art and visual culture in a broadly defined ancient world, where the art historical materials available are subject to comparable methodological constraints both from archaeological excavation and from known literary and historical contexts.<br><br><i><b>This event is free and open to the public, please RSVP.</b></i><br><br><b><span style="font-size: large;">Program</span></b><br><br><b>Friday, October 2, 2009</b><br><br><i>9:00 Opening remarks: Roger Bagnall (Director of ISAW)</i><br><br><i>Panel 1   Chair: Roger Bagnall</i><br><br>9:20 Introductory Lecture 1<br>    Wu Hung (University of Chicago) - “Consistency and Variations in Han Sarcophagi”<br><br>10:00 Introductory Lecture 2:<br>    Jas Elsner (Oxford University) - “Rhetoric in Pagan and Christian Sarcophagi”<br><br>10:40   Coffee Served in Oak Library<br><br><i>Panel 2   Chair: Jonathan Hay (IFA, New York University)</i><br><br>11:10 Paul Zanker (Scuole Normale Superiore di Pisa) - “Understanding Images Without Texts”<br><br>11:50 Alain Thote (Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes) - “The Chinese coffins from the first millennium BC and the early images of the after world”<br><br><i>12:30   Lunch Break</i><br><br><i>Panel 3   Chair: T.

<em>A Graduate Student Symposium at Yale University</em><br>February 19th and 20th, 2010 </blockquote>
<blockquote>How is digital technology changing methods of scholarly research with pre-digital sources in the humanities? If the “medium is the message,” then how does the message change when primary sources are translated into digital media? What kinds of new research opportunities do databases unlock and what do they make obsolete? What is the future of the rare book and manuscript library and its use? What biases are inherent in the widespread use of digitized material? How can we correct for them? Amidst numerous benefits in accessibility, cost, and convenience, what concerns have been overlooked? We invite graduate students to submit paper proposals for an interdisciplinary symposium that will address how databases and other digital technologies are making an impact on our research in the humanities. The graduate student panels will be moderated by a Yale faculty member or library curator with a panel respondent. The two-day conference<br>will take place February 19th and 20th, 2010, at Yale University.</blockquote>

    <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/isaw/">ISAW</a> has announced its next exhibition (and associated public programming schedule).<br><br><blockquote> <b>The Lost World of Old Europe: The Danube Valley, 5000-3500 BC</b><br><i>November 11, 2009 -April 25, 2010</i> <br><i>The Lost World of Old Europe</i> brings to the United States for the first time more than 160 objects recovered by archaeologists from the graves, towns, and villages of Old Europe, a cycle of related cultures that achieved a precocious peak of sophistication and creativity in what is now southeastern Europe between 5000 and 4000 BC, and then mysteriously collapsed by 3500 BC. Long before Egypt or Mesopotamia rose to an equivalent level of achievement, Old Europe was among the most sophisticated places that humans inhabited. Some of its towns grew to city-like sizes. Potters developed striking designs, and the ubiquitous goddess figurines found in houses and shrines have triggered intense debates about women’s roles in Old European society. Old European copper-smiths were, in their day, the most advanced metal artisans in the world. Their intense interest in acquiring copper, gold, Aegean shells, and other rare valuables created networks of negotiation that reached surprisingly far, permitting some of their chiefs to be buried with pounds of gold and copper in funerals without parallel in the Near East or Egypt at the time. The exhibition, arranged through loan agreements with 20 museums in three countries (Romania, The Republic of Bulgaria and the Republic of Moldova), brings the exuberant art, enigmatic ‘goddess’ cults, and precocious metal ornaments and weapons of Old Europe to American audiences. </blockquote>
