The project – Building Tabernae – started April, 2013, and is now about to enter a new phase, in which some results will start emerging, and new data will be gathered. The blog, I hope, is a way to force the scholar in charge of this project – me – to record and communicate the project’s successes and failures, and everything else that one encounters when investigating commercial investment in Roman Italy, and to be available for discussion with specialists and non-specialists alike.<br>feed = <a href="http://buildingtabernae.org/feed/">http://buildingtabernae.org/feed/</a><br><br><b>title = Archaeology of Portus: Exploring the Lost Harbour of Ancient Rome</b><br>url = <a href="http://moocs.southampton.ac.uk/portus/">http://moocs.southampton.ac.uk/portus/</a><br>creators = University of Southampton and FutureLearn<br>license = None<br>description = The University of Southampton and FutureLearn are running a MOOC (Massive Open Online Course), focusing on the archaeological work in progress at the Roman site of Portus.
