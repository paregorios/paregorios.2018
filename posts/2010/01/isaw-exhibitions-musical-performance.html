Some of the musical traditions                           included are Colinde (Winter Songs/Carols) , Bocete (Death Laments), Doina (Lyrical                           Songs) and Wedding Songs. Each song will be presented with sensitivity to traditional                           methods of interpretation, while bringing in new elements such as sound samples of folk                           instruments and improvisation by the musicians. The music will express a full spectrum                           of universal human emotion and experience, while sharing the rich repertoire of Romanian                           traditional music. Each song will be introduced with a brief description and translation                           of the words, and time will be set aside for audience questions.                        </p>                                                <p>This event is associated with the <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/isaw/oldeurope/">Lost World of Old Europe                              exhibition</a>, currently showing at ISAW.                        </p><br><br><div class="zemanta-pixie"><img src="http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=fdfb611d-4357-8690-83ba-883250bda9e1" alt="" class="zemanta-pixie-img"></div></div></body></html>
