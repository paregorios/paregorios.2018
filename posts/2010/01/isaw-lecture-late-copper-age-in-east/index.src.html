The massive interest in this cemetery is due to the abundance and                            variety of objects recovered from its graves, namely gold artifacts. Dr. Slavchev will                            discuss these grave goods (and the necropolis from which they came) in relation to Varna                            culture as a whole. The presence of artifacts in a wide range of materials at the                            cemetery, one of the burial sites of the highly-developed local community that inhabited                            the shore of Varna Bay at the time, suggests that the community was part of a developed                            network of medium and long range trading, transport and distribution of prestige items.                            Dr. Slavchev will argue that the local manufacturing of goods was predominantly aimed at                            the local community and its needs. Therefore, such prestige items could have functioned                            as gifts for exchange with neighboring cultures or as goods to be sold in the trading                            network.                         </p>                                                  <p>This lecture is associated with the <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/isaw/oldeurope/">Lost World of Old Europe exhibition</a>, currently showing at ISAW.                         </p></blockquote><p></p></body></html>
