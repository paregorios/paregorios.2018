With the establishment of Roman rule in the decades around the turn of the                            era, several of the pre-Roman hilltop forts were abandoned in favor of a developed                            network of lowland cities that became the backbone of the regional settlement hierarchy.                            This process was somewhat reversed after the late-third century CE, when archaeologists                            have dated the beginning of the occupation of hilltops (and, sometimes, the                            re-occupation of Iron Age sites). The ‘movement towards the highlands’ has traditionally                            been interpreted either as reemergence of indigenous social structures that had survived                            the Roman conquest or as the result of the insecurity provoked by the presence of                            barbarian armies in the third and fifth centuries.                          </p>                                                  <p>In the last two decades, piecemeal archaeological                            research in the northern Iberian Peninsula has begun to provide us with new information                            about these sites. Their material culture and the more accurate chronology indicate that                            traditional interpretations about the phenomenon of hilltop occupation are no longer                            valid. After reviewing some paradigmatic sites, this lecture will offer an alternative                            model to understanding the change in settlement patterns. It will be argued that                            occupation of hilltops must be understood in the context of the administrative reforms                            of the late Roman Empire and the economic changes that occurred in northern Iberia                            during late antiquity.                          </p></blockquote><p></p><br><!-- AddThis Button END --></body></html>
