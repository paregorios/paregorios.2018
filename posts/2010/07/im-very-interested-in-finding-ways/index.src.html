<html><body><p>I'm very interested in finding ways through <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/">Pleiades</a> and <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/isaw/about-projects.htm">other ISAW digital projects</a> to support <a href="http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/about/news/3325">the efforts of Leif, Elton and Eric</a> on the "Google Ancient Places (GAP): Discovering historic geographical entities in the Google Books corpus" project. In particular, I'd hope we can integrate this into the web interfaces for our projects:</p><blockquote><p>ECS will work on a Web Service and Web Widget [that] will make it possible for Webmasters to add links to the ancient texts [in Google Books] within their websites, enabling the public and researchers to search for them easily.</p></blockquote></body></html>
