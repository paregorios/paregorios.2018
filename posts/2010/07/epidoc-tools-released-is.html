<html><body><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If you visit <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/epidoc/files/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/epidoc/files/</a> you'll now  find readily downloadable releases of the following <a href="http://epidoc.sf.net">EpiDoc</a> tools: <br><ul><li>Guidelines </li><li>P5 Conversion Tools </li><li>Transcoder </li><li>Example P5 XSLTs </li><li>Example P4 XSLTs (deprecated; last/final release) </li><li>DTD (deprecated; last/final release) </li><li>Schema </li><li>CHETC JavaScript </li></ul> These releases reflect the current state of code or documentation as it  is to be found in our SVN repository. All of the tools have had  README.txt files added in order to help the person downloading them  figure out what they are and how to start using them. They also all have  LICENSE.txt files that spell out the terms under which they are  distributed. If you want to see our agenda, feel free to visit:  <a href="http://epidocroadmap.pbworks.com/Release-Sprint-July-2010">http://epidocroadmap.pbworks.com/Release-Sprint-July-2010</a> <br><br>Some of these packages are out-of-date or not feature-complete (e.g.,  especially the guidelines). We'll want to marshal volunteers in coming  weeks and months to work on these discrepancies. There is in fact, already a group working hard on the guidelines. If  you're not part of that group and would like to be, please shout out  about it on <a href="http://lsv.uky.edu/archives/markup.html">the markup list</a>. <br><br>My hearty thanks to Gabriel Bodard, Hugh Cayless and Charlotte Tupman,  who assisted in today's sprint, and to Marion Lame, who also volunteered  but could not be available during the time that I had scheduled. <br><br>Our next big step is to update  <a href="http://epidoc.sourceforge.net/resources.shtml">http://epidoc.sourceforge.net/resources.shtml</a> so that it properly  reports on the state of each tool and links directly to the appropriate  release. I'll be issuing a call for volunteers for that follow-up sprint shortly.</div></body></html>
