<html><body><p>Today we've published two updates to the content in <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/">Pleiades</a>.<br></p><div><br></div><div><a href="http://sgillies.net/">Sean Gillies</a> has contributed updated coordinates and descriptive information for the so-called <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/149500"><i>Pont Julien</i></a>, a Roman bridge (ancient name, if any, unknown), located to the west of <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/147993">Apta Iulia</a> (mod. Apt) in France. It had been indicated on <i>Barrington Atlas</i> Map 15 E2). The <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/149500/point-location">point coordinates</a> Sean provides, <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/149500.kml">as you'll see from the KML</a> if you've got <a href="http://earth.google.com/">Google Earth</a>, are more precise than the <i>BAtlas</i> map could provide given its scale of 1:500,000 (+/- 930 meters). Their derivation from Google Earth and Geoeye imagery is described in <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/features/metadata/google-geoeye-2010">the associated accuracy assessment</a>.</div><div><br></div><div>With help from <a href="http://www.unc.edu/awmc/people.html#awmcDirector">Brian Turner</a> and <a href="http://history.unc.edu/faculty/talbert.html">Richard Talbert</a>, I've remedied an oversight in the<i> Barrington Atlas:</i> the omission of the <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/142847211">Στροφάδες/Strophades islands</a>.  We'd <a href="http://www.unc.edu/awmc/baUpdate_3.html">originally addressed this oversight</a> back in 2003, when I still worked for the <a href="http://www.unc.edu/awmc/">Ancient World Mapping Center</a>, having been alerted to the problem by <a href="http://www.classics.uga.edu/faculty/lafleur.html">Rick LaFleur</a>.  After Sean loaded the legacy information associated with <i>BAtlas</i> Map 1 into Pleiades, I started working on a place resource as well. In so doing, I dug a bit deeper and discovered the ancient tradition of an alternate, earlier name for this peculiar island group: Πλωταί/Plotae. Once again, Google Earth provided us with better coordinates, although not this time without some confusion (see <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/features/metadata/c3a632ea-ac6d-4305-b8b1-9c33bc871c13">the associated accuracy assessment</a> and the map on <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/142847211">the main resource page</a>). I was also able to exploit the greater flexibility provided by Pleiades to enumerate all the attested name variants (including an ethnikon asserted by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephanus_of_Byzantium">Stephanus of Byzantium</a>), in their original orthography, and to provide citations of most of the relevant attestations of same in ancient literature.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>It's great to see Pleiades moving closer to full-spectrum use. We're no longer just bringing material forward from the Classical Atlas Project, we're also publishing new, more accurate and complete information. I hope that soon you'll be seeing more of this sort of thing, with contributions by a widening community. You can be part of this community, if you're interested: <a href="http://www.atlantides.org/trac/pleiades/wiki/PleiadesCommunity">here's how</a>.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks to all, including our editors, who helped get these resources ready to publish.</div></body></html>
