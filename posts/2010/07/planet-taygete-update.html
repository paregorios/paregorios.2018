<html><body><p>I just learned, thanks to a blog post at the old blog, that the website and blog for the <a href="http://digashkelon.com/">Leon Levy Expedition to Ashkelon</a> has moved but not put any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_redirection">standard redirects</a> in place at the old blog or feed. I've updated the subscription list for <a href="http://planet.atlantides.org/taygete/">Taygete Atlantis</a> to point at the new source, where I see there are a large number of posts (since early June) that I had missed.</p></body></html>
