I'm currently hosting *paregorios.org* via GitHub pages, but I'm looking for an alternative because there are features I need that GitHub doesn't provide. Here, I think, is a description of my ideal solution:

<!-- TEASER_END -->

 - Apache web server with ability to use ```.htaccess``` files (because I want to be able to issue HTTP redirects)
 - SSL with Let's Encrypt
 - Deploy via ssh+rsync using ssh keys
 - Cost: less than $10/month

I wonder where I will be able to find such a combination.
