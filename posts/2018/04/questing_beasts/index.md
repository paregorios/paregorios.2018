For those at home following my [Hosting Quest](link://slug/hosting_quest), here are the suggested providers given me (so far) by friends and social media contacts:

<!-- TEASER_END -->

 - [AWS Lightsail](https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/)
 - [Cloudvault.me](https://cloudvault.me/)
 - [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)
 - [EsoSoft](http://esosoft.com/webhosting/)
 - [Linode](https://www.linode.com/)
 - [Mythic Beasts](https://www.mythic-beasts.com/)
 - [Reclaim Hosting](https://reclaimhosting.com)
 - [Tiger Technologies](https://www.tigertech.net/)
 - [Vidahost](https://www.vidahost.com/web-hosting/pricing)
 - [Webarchitects](https://www.webarchitects.co.uk/shared-hosting)

There's a lot to like about all these recommendations; however, I'm going with Tiger Technologies for now. I like their combination of green power, [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/), free [HTTPS over TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) using a certificate from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), free domain name management and renewal, free WHOIS privacy, email, ssh/shell, and unmetered bandwidth.

I'll let you know how it goes.
