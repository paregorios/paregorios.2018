<html><body><p>So, my brain has mashed up its happiness at the success of <a href="https://plus.google.com/116427745746305527780/posts/fTXi1HbFrhC">last week's Pleiades community meetup</a> with the hanging conversations that started in response to my blog post on <a href="http://horothesia.blogspot.com/2011/09/feeds-of-flickr-photos-depicting.html">Pleiades machine tags in Flickr</a>. Nate Nagy (<a href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/awib/">AWIB</a> Managing Editor) and I had a good conversation a couple of weeks ago about the future of AWIB, one that would be more open and collaborative than the current model.<br><br>I'd like to light a fire under (and refine) those ideas. I'm starting a Doodle poll to find a time for a "future of AWIB" meetup, to be held via Google+. I'll send invites to all of our contacts on Flickr and others who have expressed interest. <b>Please post a comment here if you'd like to be part of the event.</b></p></body></html>
