<html><body><p>I'm thinking it's time. Time we designated a particular day to give over to ganging up on Pleiades content and making it better. Looking at the low-hanging-and-annoying-fruit list, the first thing that comes to mind is improving our titles and descriptions to facilitate discovery and disambiguation. I've laid out what I see as the landscape in a document on the Pleiades site: <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/docs/content-development-projects/improving-titles-and-descriptions-for-prominent-places">Improving Titles and Descriptions for Prominent Places</a>.<br><br>So what remains is to see who would be willing to devote at least a couple of hours (if not a whole day) to this enterprise and to fix a day for it. You don't need to be an expert to help with this job. Anyone interested at all in ancient geography who has basic web skills and can get on the internet at the scheduled time should be able to make a substantive contribution, whether they are a student, a scholar or an interested "layperson".<br><br>If you're interested, leave a comment on my blog and I'll send you a link to a doodle poll to do the scheduling.</p></body></html>
