A team of researchers led by <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/isaw/people-bagnall_cv.htm">Dr. Roger Bagnall</a>, Director of the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World at NYU, began the <a href="http://www.amheida.org/">Amheida Project</a> in 2001 with an intensive investigation and survey of the site.<br><br>One of the most spectacular discoveries, near the center of the town in Area 2, is the house of Serenus, who was part of the city council in the middle of the 4th century. The structure contains fifteen rooms, one of which was painted with classical wall scenes. On the northern wall, to the left of the doorway, a mythological scene depicts the legend of Perseus rescuing the beautiful Andromeda who is about to be devoured by a sea-monster, while to the right of the door is the Homeric scene of the Return of Odysseus to Ithaca, from his long voyage which brought him to Egyptian shores.<br><br>The site at Amheida will be part of a long-term scheme for the Dakhla Oasis Project.
