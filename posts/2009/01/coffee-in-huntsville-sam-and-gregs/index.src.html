<html><body><p>I finally made good on my long-standing intention to drop in at <a href="http://www.samandgregs.com/">Sam and Greg's Pizzeria/Gelateria</a> on the north side of the square in downtown Huntsville today (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;q=119+North+Side+Square,+Huntsville,+AL&amp;fb=1&amp;split=1&amp;cid=0,0,10114298661214155859&amp;ll=34.73142,-86.585183&amp;spn=0.00947,0.022745&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=A">map</a>). The veggie pizza for lunch was great and so was a properly made cappuccino (using beans locally roasted around the corner at the <a href="http://www.kaffeeklatsch.com/">Kaffeeklatsch</a>, a Huntsville standby since 1977; <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;q=103+Jefferson+Street,+Huntsville,+AL&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;split=0&amp;ll=34.731755,-86.586514&amp;spn=0.00947,0.022745&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr">map</a>).<br><br>Both staff and fellow customers at Sam and Greg's were friendly, and the place is very comfortable. I anticipate spending alot more time there.</p></body></html>
