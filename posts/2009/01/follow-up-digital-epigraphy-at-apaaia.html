<html><body><p>Just a quick note -- for the moment -- to follow up on <a href="http://horothesia.blogspot.com/2009/01/study-and-publication-of-inscriptions.html">Saturday morning's panel</a>. What a blast! Thanks to everyone who attended and to our presenters. And thanks to <a href="http://www.case.edu/artsci/clsc/faculty/iversen.html">Paul Iversen</a> for doing all the grunt work of setting up the session, issuing the call, and marshaling the administrative details. Thanks also to <a href="http://www.case.edu/artsci/clsc/asgle/">ASGLE</a> for sponsoring our session.<br><br>Unfortunately, two of our scheduled presenters weren't able to deliver their papers, but <a href="http://eer.hypotheses.org/">Marion</a> and then <a href="http://www.cch.kcl.ac.uk/legacy/tmp/profiles/gb.htm">Gabby</a> and Ryan produced well-honed, timely and interesting presentations on topic maps for representing historical analysis involving inscriptions and preliminary work in 3D laser scanning of curse tablets (respectively). I hope we'll have their slides to post soon.<br><br>Then Paul and I invited our audience to come back after the scheduled break for an open-ended discussion on epigraphy and digital methodologies. We were surprised and delighted to have over 25 people return! A challenging and interesting range of questions, ideas and project reports ensued. I intend to blog about these soon -- especially the things we identified as needing further attention and follow-up -- over at <a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.currentepigraphy.org">Current Epigraphy</a>.</p></body></html>
