I was a clueless freshman in the fall of 1985, sent there by Bill Willis (cf. <a href="http://www.apaclassics.org/Newsletter/2000newsletter/82000news.pdf"><i>APA Newsletter,</i> 23.4, August 2000</a>, p. 11 sub "Obituaries" [pdf]) to collect a copy of the then already out-of-print <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/307113">Allen's <i>First Year of Greek</i></a>.<br><br>Cluelessness on my part of course is proved by the fact I'd elected to take Greek. As a freshman. At 9:00 a.m. With no prior Latin. From a papyrologist. Some will of course already have guessed that that experience, harrowing as it was, is no small part of why I do what I do professionally today. <br><br>So long, Book Ex. And thanks.</body></html>
