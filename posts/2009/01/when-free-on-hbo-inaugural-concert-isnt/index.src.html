<html><body><p>Update 2:<br><br>I came home from the gym at 4:00 this afternoon and noticed the message indicator on my DVR was lit. The message: a notice that the inaugural concert would be live broadcast free on the local access channel 13 (so I missed it) and rebroadcast on the same channel at 6 this evening.<br><br>.....<br><br>So I called my cable provider (<a href="http://www.mediacomcc.com/home.html">Mediacom</a>) this morning -- the monopoly cable TV provider in much of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_County,_Alabama">Madison County Alabama</a> outside the Huntsville city limits -- to ask if they would be allowing their customers access to the <a href="http://www.hbo.com/weareone/">"free" HBO coverage of tomorrow's inaugural concert</a>.<br><br>After 10 minutes on hold, the representative returned to apologetically inform me that only current HBO subscribers would be able to see the concert. In other words: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soup_Nazi">no soup for you</a>.<br><br>Both <a href="http://www.directv.com/DTVAPP/global/contentPageNR.jsp?assetId=P5370022">DirectTV </a>and <a href="http://www.hbo.com/camp/200808DM/index.html">Dish</a> (the two satellite providers that compete with Mediacom here) are trumpeting on their websites the fact that they are providing free HBO for the event (and more).  If I want to make Mediacom pay, I'll have to switch to satellite and get AT&amp;T to install DSL at my house (and then live with the thinner data pipe). Right now I'm tempted, despite the costs, hassles and lower-value internet connection. Not that it would get me access to the concert in time.<br><br>Aside: Yes, I know I can watch it streaming from HBO.com. I applaud HBO for providing that workaround for dealing with their less civic-minded local outlets. Of course, we might blame the inaugural committee for making this <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/16/AR2009011604921.html">an exclusive deal</a> with HBO (but then somebody's got to pay for all this celebratory activity).<br><br>But to return to my main line of rant: what's Mediacom's excuse? Lameness? A callous decision to try to make money by requiring an upgrade to subscription to get HBO access for the event?<br><br>I call it FAIL.<br><br>Update:<br><br>According to media reports, Mediacom will air the special free for folks in <a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20090117/LIFE/901170305/-1/archive&amp;theme=INAUGURATION_NEWS">Des Moines Iowa</a> and <a href="http://www.valdostadailytimes.com/local/local_story_016232845.html">Valdosta, Georgia</a>. What makes them more special than Madison County Alabama?</p></body></html>
