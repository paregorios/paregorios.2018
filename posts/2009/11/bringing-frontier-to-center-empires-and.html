For both empires, the nomadic communities to the north were an especially important constituency that was complicated by strong dynastic hereditary ties. In each case, a conscious program specifically addressing this complex and mobile community was developed and was expressed through the official language (text and images) of the imperial court. An exploration of those programs reveals striking parallels in their approach to maintaining imperial control and cooperation.<br></blockquote><br>Monday, 6:00 pm<br>November 30, 2009<br><br>Lecture Hall<br>ISAW Building<br>15 East 84th Street<br>New York, NY 10028<br>isaw@nyu.edu<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">this event is free and open to the public </span></body></html>
