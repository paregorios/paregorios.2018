Whereas the chronological and formal developments of each regional tradition remain an important research goal, this conference encourages comparative observations and interpretations of ancient sarcophagi in broader geo-cultural spheres and more specific ritual/religious contexts. It is hoped that by addressing these two research objectives simultaneously, this conference will help open new ways to think about the development of art and visual culture in a broadly defined ancient world, where the art historical materials available are subject to comparable methodological constraints both from archaeological excavation and from known literary and historical contexts.<br><br><i><b>This event is free and open to the public, please RSVP.</b></i><br><br><b><span style="font-size: large;">Program</span></b><br><br><b>Friday, October 2, 2009</b><br><br><i>9:00 Opening remarks: Roger Bagnall (Director of ISAW)</i><br><br><i>Panel 1   Chair: Roger Bagnall</i><br><br>9:20 Introductory Lecture 1<br>    Wu Hung (University of Chicago) - “Consistency and Variations in Han Sarcophagi”<br><br>10:00 Introductory Lecture 2:<br>    Jas Elsner (Oxford University) - “Rhetoric in Pagan and Christian Sarcophagi”<br><br>10:40   Coffee Served in Oak Library<br><br><i>Panel 2   Chair: Jonathan Hay (IFA, New York University)</i><br><br>11:10 Paul Zanker (Scuole Normale Superiore di Pisa) - “Understanding Images Without Texts”<br><br>11:50 Alain Thote (Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes) - “The Chinese coffins from the first millennium BC and the early images of the after world”<br><br><i>12:30   Lunch Break</i><br><br><i>Panel 3   Chair: T.
