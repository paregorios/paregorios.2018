<html><body><p>By way of <a href="http://twitter.com/brettbobley/status/4011059063">a tweet from Brett Bobley</a>, I learned about <a href="http://digitalhumanities.yale.edu/pdp/">this call for papers</a>:<br><br></p><div class="entry">     <blockquote><h1><span style="font-size: small;">***<em>Deadline Extended to September 30th</em>***</span></h1><h1><span style="font-size: large;">The Past’s Digital Presence:<br>Database, Archive, and Knowledge Work in the Humanities</span></h1><em>A Graduate Student Symposium at Yale University</em><br>February 19th and 20th, 2010 </blockquote><blockquote>How is digital technology changing methods of scholarly research with pre-digital sources in the humanities? If the “medium is the message,” then how does the message change when primary sources are translated into digital media? What kinds of new research opportunities do databases unlock and what do they make obsolete? What is the future of the rare book and manuscript library and its use? What biases are inherent in the widespread use of digitized material? How can we correct for them? Amidst numerous benefits in accessibility, cost, and convenience, what concerns have been overlooked? We invite graduate students to submit paper proposals for an interdisciplinary symposium that will address how databases and other digital technologies are making an impact on our research in the humanities. The graduate student panels will be moderated by a Yale faculty member or library curator with a panel respondent. The two-day conference<br>will take place February 19th and 20th, 2010, at Yale University.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Keynote Speaker:</strong> <a href="http://www.english.upenn.edu/People/Faculty/profile.php?pennkey=pstally">Peter Stallybrass</a>, Walter H. and Leonore C.
