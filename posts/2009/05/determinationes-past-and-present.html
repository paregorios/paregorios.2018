<html><body><span style="font-style: italic;">Determinatio</span> is a Latin term (Greek: ἀφορισμός or ὁροθέσια) for the written, serial description of boundaries, produced as necessary by Roman surveyors and routinely included in the verdicts of Roman (pro-)magistrates and <span style="font-style: italic;">iudices</span> when settling boundary disputes.<br><br>Here's an example, dating to the early second century CE:<br><br>Serving as proconsul of either Achaia or Macedonia, <a href="http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/sentius_augurinusx.html">Q.
