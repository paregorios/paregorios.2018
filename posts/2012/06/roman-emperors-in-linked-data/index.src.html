<html><body><p>You can jump right to <a href="https://github.com/paregorios/roman-emperors">the roman-emperors github repository here</a>. I repeat the README file here for the benefit of those who'd rather look before they leap:<br></p><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, arial, freesans, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">This dataset uses the published dbpedia resource URIs for Roman Emperors (the persons themselves) as a starting point for making useful assertions about these individuals in the linked data space. The main goal is to align these URIs with any other key URIs (now or in the future) for the same persons and then to attribute these "same as" relationships with links to descriptive documents or other data that have not so far made it into the linked data graph (especially legacy web resources). Multiple names for the emperors are only incidental to the dataset; no attempt is being made to produce (in this dataset) a comprehensive set of alternate names.</span></blockquote>It's still a work in progress, but I've made it available under the <a href="http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/">Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License</a> so anyone who's interested can pitch in and help, or make use of it freely.<br><br>Both RDF (Turtle) and CSV versions are included.</body></html>
