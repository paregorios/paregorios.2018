<html><body><p>A few days ago <a href="http://horothesia.blogspot.com/2012/06/roman-emperors-in-linked-data.html">I blogged about an open linked dataset about Roman Emperors</a>. I've now more formally published the dataset online at <a href="http://www.paregorios.org/resources/roman-emperors/">http://www.paregorios.org/resources/roman-emperors/</a>.<br><br>I'll be adding more features and data, and improving the dataset description in coming weeks. More information on how to contribute is also forthcoming (and I have a couple of early contributions by others to incorporate as soon as possible!).<br><br>I'll blog more here with the label <a href="http://horothesia.blogspot.com/search/label/romemplod">romemplod</a> whenever there's a significant update.</p></body></html>
