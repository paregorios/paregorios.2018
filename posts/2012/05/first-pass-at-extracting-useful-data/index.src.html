<html><body><i>You'll find context in <a href="http://horothesia.blogspot.com/2012/05/open-access-epigraphic-evidence-for.html">yesterday's post on the dissertation</a>.</i><br><br>It turns out it wasn't as hard as I anticipated to start getting useful information extracted from my born-digital-for-printing-on-dead-trees dissertation. Here's a not-yet-perfect xml serialization (borrowing tags from the TEI) of "instance" information found in the diss narrative:<br><br><a href="https://github.com/paregorios/demarc/blob/master/xml/instances.xml">https://github.com/paregorios/demarc/blob/master/xml/instances.xml</a><br><br>Each instance is a historical event (or in some cases event series) relating to boundary demarcation or dispute within the empire. Here's a comparison between the original formatting for paper and the xml.<br><br>For paper:<br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nu_yP3-852Q/T71bfc35IOI/AAAAAAAAAQE/MTtfTmuT0PQ/s1600/wookie.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" height="390" width="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nu_yP3-852Q/T71bfc35IOI/AAAAAAAAAQE/MTtfTmuT0PQ/s400/wookie.png"></a></div>  <br>XML:<br><pre style="font-family: Andale Mono, Lucida Console, Monaco, fixed, monospace; color: #000000; background-color: #eee;font-size: 12px;border: 1px dashed #999999;line-height: 14px;padding: 5px; overflow: auto; width: 100%"><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;<br>&lt;div type="instance" xml:id="INST9"&gt;<br>  &lt;idno type="original"&gt;INST9&lt;/idno&gt;<br>  &lt;head&gt;A Negotiated Boundary between the &lt;placeName <br>    type="ancient"&gt;Zamucci&lt;/placeName&gt; and the &lt;placeName <br>    type="ancient"&gt;Muduciuvi&lt;/placeName&gt;&lt;/head&gt;<br>  &lt;p rend="indent"&gt;Burton 2000, no. 78&lt;/p&gt;<br>  &lt;p&gt;Date(s): &lt;date&gt;AD 86&lt;/date&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br>  &lt;p type="treDisputeStatement"&gt;This boundary marker was placed in <br>    accordance with the agreement of both parties (&lt;foreign xml:lang="la"&gt;ex <br>    conven/tione utrarumque nationum&lt;/foreign&gt;), and therefore may be taken as<br>    evidence of a &lt;hi rend="bold"&gt;boundary dispute&lt;/hi&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;<br>  &lt;p rend="indent"&gt;This single boundary marker from coastal &lt;placeName <br>    type="modern"&gt;Libya&lt;/placeName&gt; provides the only evidence for the resolution<br>    of a boundary dispute between these two indigenous peoples. The date of the <br>    demarcation, as calculated from the imperial titulature, places the event in <br>    the same year as the reported ‘destruction’ of the &lt;placeName <br>    type="ancient"&gt;Nasamones&lt;/placeName&gt; by &lt;placeName type="ancient"&gt;Legio III <br>    Augusta&lt;/placeName&gt; as a consequence of a tax revolt in which tax collectors <br>    were killed.&lt;note n="286"&gt; Zonaras 11.19. &lt;/note&gt; It is not clear whether <br>    the boundary action was related to the conflict, or merely took advantage of<br>    the temporary presence of the legionary legate in what ought to have been<br>    part of the proconsular province. Surviving documentation for proconsuls<br>    during the 80s AD is incomplete, and therefore we cannot say who was<br>    governing &lt;placeName type="ancient"&gt;Africa Proconsularis &lt;/placeName&gt;at the <br>    time of this demarcation.&lt;note n="287"&gt; Thomasson 1996, 45-48. &lt;/note&gt;<br>    Neither party seems to have been related to the &lt;placeName <br>    type="ancient"&gt;Nasamones&lt;/placeName&gt;; rather, they are thought to be sub-<br>    tribes of the &lt;placeName type="ancient"&gt;Macae.&lt;/placeName&gt;&lt;note <br>    n="288"&gt;Mattingly 1994, 27-28, 32, 74, 76.. &lt;/note&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt;<br><br></code></pre><br><br>One thing that made this a lot easier than it might of been was the way I used styles in Microsoft Word back when I created the original version of the document. Rather than just painting formatting onto my text for headings, paragraphs, strings of characters, and so forth, I created a custom "style" for each type of thing I wanted to paint (e.g., an "instance heading" or a "personal name"). I associated the desired visual formatting with each of these, but the names themselves (since the captured semantic distinctions that I was interested in) provided hooks today for writing this stuff out as sort-of TEI XML.<br><br>There's more to do, obviously, but this was a satisfying first step.</body></html>
