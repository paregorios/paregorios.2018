<html><body><a href="http://electricarchaeologist.wordpress.com/">Shawn</a> is trying out the <a href="http://horothesia.blogspot.com/2007/09/feeds-for-pleiades-data.html">Pleiades Atom+GeoRSS</a> feeds in Yahoo Pipes, and is also thinking about <a href="http://electricarchaeologist.wordpress.com/2007/09/17/bibliocartography/">geoparsing locational data from regular bibliography</a>. <br><br>Seems to me it would be fun to throw something like <a href="http://zcologia.com/news/">Sean Gillies</a>' <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Azcologia.com%2Fnews%2F+mush">Mush</a> into the mix to get spatial correlations between the Pleiades gazetteer (if I can call it that in this context) and Shawn's geo-bib. <br><br>Then, if we could apply some version of the combined process to, say, the <a href="http://www.libraries.uc.edu/libraries/classics/information/newacq070807.html">new acquisitions list</a> of the <a href="http://www.libraries.uc.edu/libraries/classics/">Burnam Classics Library</a> in Cincinnati, we'd have some nifty pre-processing that could speed identification of new works to cite in the <a href="http://www.unc.edu/awmc/pleiades/bibliography">Pleiades bibliography</a>.</body></html>
