Other residents will be housed in college dorms, churches, libraries and research halls. City planners hope they can develop enough shelter space to house 300,000 people; enough space to provide every person in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_County%2C_Alabama">Huntsville and the surrounding county</a> a safe refuge.</blockquote><br>Maybe <a href="http://www.al.com/news/huntsvilletimes/lroop.ssf">Lee</a> can find out what it's all about.</body></html>
