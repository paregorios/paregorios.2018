<html><body><p>That substantial seismic WHOMP! you felt last Friday was the <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/index.html">1.0 release of the Text Encoding Initiative, version P5</a> making its official entry into the light of day. A hearty congratulations to the editors, the TEI Technical Council, and everyone else who worked so hard to make this major revision a reality.<br><br>As a sizable percentage of my legions of readers will know, the TEI underpins the work of the <a href="http://epidoc.sf.net">EpiDoc Community</a>, which aims to provide guidance and tools for the XML markup of ancient primary sources -- especially documentary ones -- preserved in inscriptions, on papyri and the like. Right now, EpiDoc depends on the previous (P4) version of the TEI, but incorporates a number of P5 structures that are especially useful (or economical) for our needs. We'll hold at this point until sometime at least in mid-2008, when we'll look at revising EpiDoc to full P5 compliance. This delay recognizes that key members of the community will be pretty busy in the meantime on a number of projects that shouldn't be slowed down for a major revision.<br><br>A particularly important current project in this regard is the conversion of the <a href="http://scriptorium.lib.duke.edu/papyrus/texts/DDBDP.html">Duke Databank of Documentary Papyri</a> (description somewhat out of date) to full EpiDoc conformance. This conversion underpins an effort to establish better interoperability with the <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/projects/digital/apis/">Advanced Papyrological Information System</a> and the <a href="http://www.rzuser.uni-heidelberg.de/%7Egv0/gvz.html">Heidelberger Gesamtverzeichnis der griechischen Papyrusurkunden Ã„gyptens</a>. This <a href="http://library.duke.edu/news/main/2007/article45.html">APIS/Duke/HGV work is funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a>, and it's driving major improvements to the EpiDoc Guidelines and software tools.<br><br>There's also an interesting, and rapidly growing, <a href="http://epidoc.sf.net/projects.shtml">list of other EpiDoc projects</a>.</p></body></html>
