<html><body><p>Yesterday, <a href="http://zcologia.com/sgillies">Sean</a> pointed out that the <a href="http://www.okfn.org/">Open Knowledge Foundation</a> has been stalking <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org">Pleiades</a> (in the best possible way). Most recently (on Monday), <a href="http://www.okfn.org/about/people/#head-5ced757fcedf50f9fc7199059ebc608e296cbe2e">Rufus Pollock</a> had <a href="http://blog.okfn.org/2007/11/12/pleiades-lots-of-ancient-geodata-released/">nice things to say about how we're releasing our data</a>. Thanks! It's as useful to get praise for specific aspects of our approach as it is to get criticism; it helps us keep tabs on what not to change.</p></body></html>
