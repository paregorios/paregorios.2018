<html><body><p>A session just announced for the 2008 meeting of the <a href="http://www.aag.org/">Association of American Geographers</a> (April 15-19, 2008 in Boston):<br></p><blockquote>The emergence of Historical GIS projects over the last decade has provided us with a variety of datasets and data models to use in our research. In some cases the HGIS projects are focused on providing a basic infrastructure for the historical geography of a particular region, in other cases the HGIS projects developed innovative tools for spatiotemporal analysis. This session will focus on practical approaches to Historical GIS with four case studies: first, how to develop applications for the study of change over time that makes use of existing Historical GIS data. Second, the representation of historical enumeration districts and how to use and interpret measures of spatial segregation. Third, the examination of cartographic uncertainty in georeferencing ancient maps. And fourth, an examination of the structural content of both Print Historical Atlases and Historical GIS.</blockquote>You can also read the <a href="http://www.fas.harvard.edu/%7Echgis/meetings/aag_2008/">full panel description for Methodological approaches to Historical GIS</a>, complete with individual paper abstracts.<br><br><blockquote></blockquote></body></html>
