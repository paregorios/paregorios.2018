<html><body><p>It should be easy for projects outside <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/">Pleiades</a> to assert relationships between their content (primary and secondary sources, images, find records etc.) and ours. It should be easy for Pleiades users to stumble upon (or search for) these assertions (via maps or other means). It should be easy to harvest these assertions and pump them through our editorial workflow.<br><br>We already use <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287">Atom</a> + <a href="http://georss.org/">GeoRSS</a>, as well as <a href="http://earth.google.com/kml/index.html">KML</a>, to expose Pleiades content for discovery and reuse by others. It's clean, simple, standard and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">RESTful</a>. No heavy architecture. No elaborate call-and-response rituals. No home-made schemas or protocols.<br><br>Can we turn the telescope around and ask other projects to use the same mechanisms -- maybe with a little semantic sugar in the form of a simple relationships thesaurus -- to communicate with us (and each other)?<br><br>So, I tried to imagine <a href="http://icon.stoa.org/trac/pleiades/wiki/AtomInsAph4-202">an Atom+GeoRSS feed for an inscription from Aphrodisias</a> that's already published to the web. You'll see from the comments that there are a number of distinctions I'd like to see from the Pleiades side that just don't fit. <a href="http://www.mta.ca/faculty/humanities/classics/Robertson/">Bruce Robertson</a> has lately got me thinking about <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a>, so I tried my hand at <a href="http://icon.stoa.org/trac/pleiades/wiki/RDFInsAph4-202">an RDF encoding of the missing stuff</a> too. Maybe an XML version of the RDF could go into the Atom feed using its standard extension mechanisms.<br><br>Thoughts? Corrections? Suggestions?</p></body></html>
