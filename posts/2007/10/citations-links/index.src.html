<html><body><p>I've been thinking a lot about scholarly citation and hyperlinking lately. I've been struggling to test mentally the degree to which the latter can support what I see as the distinct functions of the former:<br></p><ul><li>attribution of argument or idea<br></li><li>source of fact or quotation<br></li><li>pointer to further information not directly germane to the issue at hand<br></li><li>disambiguation</li><li>classification<br></li></ul>I'd be grateful for suggested additions to, and refinements of, the list of functions. It would also be helpful to learn of any literature on the subject.<br><br>Of course the goal is "computationally actionable citation."</body></html>
