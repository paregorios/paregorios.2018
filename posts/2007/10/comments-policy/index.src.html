<html><body><p>I moderate the comments for this blog, and reserve the right to reject or retract any comment at any time, and to turn commenting off for particular posts. I'll consider the following factors (non-exhaustive list) in making moderation decisions:</p><ol><li id="nospam">no spam; this includes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog_spam">blog spam</a> like "if you're interested in that, you might want to look at my site" or "visit this site to learn more about this subject"</li><li>no personal attacks, hate speech or the like</li><li>no <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=define%3Aflamebait">flamebait</a></li><li>relevance: the comment should address in some substantive way the content of the blog post to which it is attached. Feel free to include relevant links in your comments, but the comment itself should provide substantive content (this is the counter-point to the <a href="#nospam">no spam</a> rule above).</li></ol></body></html>
