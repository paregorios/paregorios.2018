Plone automagically deals with either formulation. We <strong>could</strong> get pedantic and say that some of these are containers and therefore ought to have no trailing slash, but then there's the fact that implementation-wise a place object is a container too. But I don't think users need or want to have to think about these things this way.</p><p>So, I think canonical URLs for places and names and lists of same have no trailing slashes; however, our application will pleasantly handle trailing slashes.</p><p>Stay tuned for responses to Sebastian's other points anon ...</p></body></html>
