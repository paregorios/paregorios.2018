<html><body><p>Now, I don't really know a thing about <a href="http://horothesia.blogspot.com/2007/09/duck-and-cover.html">this sort of thing</a>, but this aspect of the <a href="http://www.madisoncountyema.com/Fallout.html">Huntsville Fallout Shelter Plan</a> (most recently <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jtBuR84p6FU4UpQRIk9iZfnn5HEQ">covered by the Associated Press</a>) seems like a recipe for trouble:</p><blockquote cite="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jtBuR84p6FU4UpQRIk9iZfnn5HEQ"><p>Unlike the fallout shelters set up during the Cold War, the new ones will not be stocked with water, food or other supplies. For survivors of a nuclear attack, it would be strictly "BYOE" — bring your own everything. Just throw down a sleeping bag on the courthouse floor — or move some of the rocks on the mine floor — and make yourself at home.</p><p>"We do not guarantee them comfort, just protection," said <a href="http://www.madisoncountyema.com/Staff.htm">[Kirk] Paradise</a>, who is coordinating the shelter plans for <a href="http://www.madisoncountyema.com/index.html">the local emergency management agency</a>.</p></blockquote><p>Hmmmm .... 20,000 people in <a href="http://www.landtrust-hsv.org/three_caves.htm">Three Caves</a> with no cots, water, food, diapers or formula above and beyond what they snatched and grabbed on the way in.</p><p>And that's not even a comment about the overall goodness of the plan.</p><p>In a future random post, I may explore just how accessible Three Caves would be for a freaked-out crowd of 20,000 North Alabamians.</p><p>All the usual <abbr title="I am not a bunker or homeland security expert">IANABOHSE</abbr> caveats apply.</p></body></html>
