<html><body><p>And here's another call for papers, this one for a panel co-organized by <a href="http://www.case.edu/artsci/clsc/faculty/iversen.html">Paul Iversen</a> and myself for the <a href="http://www.case.edu/artsci/clsc/asgle/" title="American Society of Greek and Latin Epigraphy">ASGLE</a> Panel at the 2009 (sic) <a href="http://www.apaclassics.org" title="American Philological Association">APA</a>/<a href="http://www.archaeological.org" title="Archaeological Institute of America">AIA</a> meeting in Philadelphia (8-11 January 2009):<br></p><blockquote>The computer age has unleashed powerful new technologies that enhance the study of Greek and Latin inscriptions, yet most scholars, academic institutions and publishing houses are still not comfortable with the idea of publishing inscriptions in a form that takes full advantage of the new possibilities. The Society, therefore, welcomes papers that discuss current or possible future computer-enhanced initiatives in the areas of Greek and Latin Epigraphy. We are particularly interested in papers that discuss theoretical applications of new technologies to the field of epigraphy and the formulation of international standards and protocols of publication and institutional credit, especially digital projects that go well beyond the mere encoding of the appearance of epigraphical sigla and indicia (which is akin to putting old wine into new wineskins) to include the encoding of semantic and/or observational distinctions.<br><br>Abstracts will be adjudicated anonymously by a committee of ASGLE and should not be longer than one page. Please follow the instructions for the format of individual abstracts that will appear in the October issue of the <a href="http://www.apaclassics.org/Newsletter/newsletter.html">APA Newsletter</a>. Abstracts should be sent to: Paul A. Iversen, ASGLE Secretary-Treasurer, Department of Classics, Case Western Reserve University, 11201 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44106-7111 or paul.iversen (at) cwru.edu. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The deadline is February 1, 2008. </span><br></blockquote></body></html>
