<html><body><p>I had to miss the <a href="http://www.neh.gov/news/archive/20070702.html">Using New Technologies to Explore Cultural Heritage</a> meeting in Washington last week (I was in Lexington, Kentucky for a workshop on cyberinfrastructure in the classics ... more on that anon). But <a href="http://zcologia.com/sgillies">Sean</a> and <a href="http://history.unc.edu/faculty/talbert.html">Richard</a> went (<a href="http://zcologia.com/news/581/nehcnr-slides/">their slides are here</a>). <br><br>To judge from <a href="http://www.dancohen.org/2007/10/05/using-new-technologies-to-explore-culture-heritage-conference">Dan Cohen's post</a>, it was a great meeting. And he gave <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org">Pleiades</a> some very nice press too.</p></body></html>
