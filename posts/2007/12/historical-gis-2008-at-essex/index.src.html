It follows on from the success of a previous <a href="http://www.h-net.org/announce/show.cgi?ID=134342">Historical GIS conference</a> held at the Newberry Library, Chicago in 2004.  The main aim of the conference is to demonstrate how GIS can make a contribution to our understanding of the geographies of the past.  We welcome submissions on all aspects of using GIS in historical research from database development to applied research in which GIS has made a contribution to understanding a historical topic.  Contributions from PhD students are encouraged.  Non-speaking participants who are keen to learn what is happening in the field are also welcome.<br></blockquote>See further: <a href="http://www.hgis.org.uk/HGIS_conference/index.htm">http://www.hgis.org.uk/HGIS_conference/index.htm</a></body></html>
