<html><body><p>I wanted to blog about this as soon as it hit my feedreader, but then there was that proposal to finish. Anyway:<br><br>One of the highlights of a decade spent at <a href="http://www.unc.edu/">Carolina</a> was getting to work with <a href="http://wwwx.cs.unc.edu/%7Egb/wp/">Gary Bishop</a>, a professor in the Department of Computer Science. We found ourselves in <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/Research/assist/bats/">a collaboration initiated by Jason Morris</a>, a blind Classics graduate student who was deeply interested in ancient geography and for whom Braille maps constituted a ridiculously low-bandwidth, low-resolution disappointment. The idea of producing immersive spatial audio maps took off in the hands of a group of Gary's undergraduate students and, with some seed money from <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Research</a>, this one initiative blossomed into a <a href="http://wwwx.cs.unc.edu/%7Egb/wp/research/">research</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/Research/assist/et/2006/">teaching</a> program in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistive_technology">assistive technology</a>.<br><br>Gary's recently blogged about a cool new project: the <a href="http://wwwx.cs.unc.edu/%7Egb/wp/blog/2008/07/27/outfox-speech-sound-and-more-for-firefox/">Outfox extension for Firefox</a>, which:<br></p><blockquote>allows in-page JavaScript to access local platform services and devices such as text-to-speech synthesis, sound playback and game controllers</blockquote>It's open source (BSD License), and you can help.<br><blockquote></blockquote></body></html>
