<html><body><p>I've added a new feed aggregator: <a href="http://planet.atlantides.org/merope">Merope Atlantis</a>. This one grabs up feeds from three different Flickr groups in which some very good pictures of inscriptions are regularly being posted:<br></p><ul><li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/spolia/">Spolia (ancient inscriptions or architectural elements reused in later construction)</a><br></li><li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/562831@N24/">Visibile Parlare / Visible Words (Greek inscriptions)</a><br></li><li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/visible_words/">Visible Words / Visibile parlare (Latin inscriptions)</a><span style="font-size:85%;"></span><br></li></ul>I hope soon that it will also begin to include images and texts posted elsewhere.</body></html>
