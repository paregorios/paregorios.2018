<html><body><a href="http://www.iconoclasm.dk/?p=301">Thanks to Troels</a> I got a happy surprise this morning. The <a href="http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/" title="Bryn Mawr Classical Review: Most Recent Articles" style="font-style: italic;">Bryn Mawr Classical Review</a> has published <a href="http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/recent.xml">a web feed of recent reviews</a>. This is great news for dissemination, data sharing and general all-around knowing what's going on. I have already added the feed to the <a href="http://planet.atlantides.org/maia">Maia Atlantis aggregator</a>. Now we just need to encourage more people -- including me -- to write and submit more reviews of web publications!</body></html>
