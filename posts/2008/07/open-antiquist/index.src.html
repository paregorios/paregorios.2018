<html><body><p>Hooray for the organizers and members of <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/antiquist?hl=en">Antiquist</a>, who today have implemented their decision to convert the archives of their discussion list (which goes back to September 2006) from private to public! Antiquist describes itself as:<br></p><blockquote>An online community of people working with computing in the heritage sector.<br><br>Antiquist is primarily a communication network - a way for us to talk, argue, experiment, share ideas, and solve common problems.</blockquote></body></html>
