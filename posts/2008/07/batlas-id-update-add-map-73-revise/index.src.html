The following additions and changes were made<br></p><ul><li>IDs added for <a href="http://atlantides.org/batlas/map73.xml">Map 73 (Ammon)</a></li><li>All files refreshed so that alternative captions for rivers, islands and island groups with multiple names all carry the appropriate formulaic postfix expression (fl., Ins. Inss.); no alias IDs have been changed; no geogname elements have been changed; no features have been added or removed</li></ul>Copies of the prior versions are available for reference in an appropriately-dated subdirectory, e.g.: <a href="http://atlantides.org/batlas/2007-07-11/">http://atlantides.org/batlas/2007-07-11/</a></body></html>
