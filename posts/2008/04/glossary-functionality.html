<html><body><p>The National Weather Service has added glossary links for technical terms and acronyms in the text products surfaced via their website, <abbr title="for example" style="color: green;">e.g.</abbr> the <a href="http://www.crh.noaa.gov/product.php?site=NWS&amp;issuedby=HUN&amp;product=AFD&amp;format=CI&amp;version=1&amp;glossary=1">Huntsville Area Forecast Discussion</a>. The links point to a separate glossary application, which doesn't seem to succeed in looking up the word that's passed by the link.<br><br>:(<br><br>What I'd really love, even beyond getting this particular <abbr title="application" style="color: green;">app</abbr> to actually work, is a <span title="a pop-up window that displays when the user hovers (positions their mouse cursor) over the relevant text" style="color:green;">mouseover kite</span> containing the appropriate gloss. There are all sorts of <span title="web geek fu" style="color:green;">javascripty ways</span> to do that, but the easiest way (in a modern browser, if the gloss is short) is to simply wrap the technical term or acronym in a span element with a title attribute containing the textual <span title="i.e., the definition of the term" style="color:green;">gloss</span>. Fewer clicks, more happiness.<br><br>This sort of functionality should be a standard component, <abbr title="in my opinion" style="color: green;">IMO</abbr>, of any technical document (a classics journal article, say) that's posted to the web with any desire to reach students or a non-specialist audience. With a bit of infrastructure work, and maintenance of a glossary, it could be made to happen almost <span title="as in POOF! SHAZZAM! PRESTO CHANGEO!" style="color:green;">automagically</span> as part of a publishing workflow. I'm sure there are sites where that's already the case.<br><br></p></body></html>
