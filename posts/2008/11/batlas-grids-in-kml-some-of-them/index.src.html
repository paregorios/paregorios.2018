<html><body><p>Would you like to have simple polygons of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Barrington Atlas</span> map grid squares? Maybe for munging an existing placenames list up against <a href="http://horothesia.blogspot.com/2008/09/batlas-ids-first-full-release-all-maps.html">BAtlas IDs?</a>... We're using them to help keep you updated on <a href="http://www.atlantides.org/trac/pleiades/wiki/PleiadesContent">Pleiades content digitization status</a>.<br><br>We've started putting the grids up on the web in KML 2.2 under a cc-by-sa license. We'll keep you posted as we add more. Meanwhile, get them here: <a href="http://atlantides.org/batlas/grids/">http://atlantides.org/batlas/grids/</a></p></body></html>
