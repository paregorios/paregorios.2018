<html><body><p>I have to confess publicly, at the risk of being thought rude, that I was dumbfounded to read <a href="http://www.currentepigraphy.org/2008/09/13/bes-newsletter-19-released-but-not-online/#comment-7079">Polly Low's comment</a> this morning:<br></p><blockquote>The absence of the latest newsletter from the <a href="http://www.csad.ox.ac.uk/BES/"><abbr title="British Epigraphy Society">BES</abbr> website</a> is deliberate â€” only [listserv] subscribers get the cutting-edge news!</blockquote>Why on earth would a professional academic organization with a web presence and a mission statement thereon that contains the following words limit themselves in this way?:<br><blockquote>to promote the study of inscriptions, texts and historical documents ... disseminating news of the latest developments in epigraphic studies, in Britain and around the world<br></blockquote>Or is the real issue that "subscribers" = "members" and timely access to the newsletter is seen by the Society as an exclusive benefit of membership?</body></html>
