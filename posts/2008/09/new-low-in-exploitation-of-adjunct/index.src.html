<html><body><p>The above quote is attributed to Gwendolyn Bradley, of the American Association of University Professors, in this morning's issue of <span style="font-style: italic;">Inside Higher Education</span> where Scott Jaschik writes about a "<a href="http://insidehighered.com/news/2008/09/11/adjunct">New Form of Adjunct Abuse</a>":<br></p><blockquote>At San Antonio College ... adjuncts are being encouraged to take on extra courses, ... [but] the college is asking some part timers ... to agree in writing to pretend that they aren’t teaching 12 credits. ...<br><br>Gerald J. Davey, an adjunct at San Antonio College who has served as the adjunct representative on the Faculty Council there, did not sign a waiver, but he has spoken with those who have and is angry about the system being used. Davey said that, in years past, once an adjunct has had a contract for 12 credits, benefits and higher pay scales have kicked in — and that the waivers are an attempt to limit what adjuncts receive from the college.</blockquote>Aside:<br><br>I can't help but draw attention to this most unfortunate of "context-sensitive" advertisements that appeared alongside Jaschik's story:<br><br><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tcSZVmUJxp0/SMkgiHp7IPI/AAAAAAAAABQ/XlryJ1sge50/s1600-h/adjunctabuse.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: none; cursor: pointer;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tcSZVmUJxp0/SMkgiHp7IPI/AAAAAAAAABQ/XlryJ1sge50/s320/adjunctabuse.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5244759011592184050" border="0"></a></body></html>
