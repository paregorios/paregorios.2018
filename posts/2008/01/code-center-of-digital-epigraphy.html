<html><body><p>One of the several interesting announcements made yesterday in the annual business meeting of the <a href="http://www.case.edu/artsci/clsc/asgle/">American Society of Greek and Latin Epigraphy</a> was the establishment of a <span style="font-style: italic;">Center of Digital Epigraphy</span> at Brown University. <a href="http://research.brown.edu/research/profile.php?id=10033">John Bodel</a> (who directs the <a href="http://usepigraphy.brown.edu/">U.S. Epigraphy Project</a>) and <a href="http://research.brown.edu/myresearch/Michael_Satlow">Michael Satlow</a> (who oversees the <a href="http://www.stg.brown.edu/projects/Inscriptions/">Inscriptions of Israel/Palestine</a> repertorium) have received startup funding for this co-directed center. As more details, and a web presence (I hope) emerge, I'll blog them over at <a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.currentepigraphy.org/">Current Epigraphy</a>.</p></body></html>
