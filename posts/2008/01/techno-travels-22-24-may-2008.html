Featured projects will delve into mobility as a modality of knowledge and stake out new spaces for humanistic inquiry. How are border-crossings being re-conceptualized, experienced, and narrated in a world permeated by technologies of mobility? How is the geo-spatial web remapping physical geographies, location, and borderlands? How are digital cities interfacing with physical space? How do we move between virtual worlds? And what has become of sites of dwelling and stasis in a world saturated by techno-travels?<br><br>This year’s conference literalizes and metaphorizes travel, as attendees will participate in sessions at Irvine, Los Angeles, San Diego, and on the connecting corridors of Southern California.<br></blockquote><blockquote></blockquote></body></html>
