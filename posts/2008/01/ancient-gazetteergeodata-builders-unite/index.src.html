<html><body><p>I keep running into more and more examples of people or projects building interesting and useful datasets/gazetteers for the ancient world. Maybe we should be talking to each other in a more regular and organized fashion?<br><br>There are, of course, the big digital gazetteers (compiled from multiple sources) that incorporate some ancient sites (e.g., the open-access <a href="http://www.alexandria.ucsb.edu/gazetteer/">Alexandria Digital Library Gazetteer</a> and <a href="http://www.geonames.org/">GeoNames</a> and the proprietary <a href="http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/vocabularies/tgn/about.html">Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names</a>). But there are also established academic/historical projects like the <a href="http://www.fas.harvard.edu/%7Echgis/">China Historical GIS</a> (unfortunately <a href="http://www.fas.harvard.edu/%7Echgis/data/chgis/downloads/v4/">locked away from the geoweb by its license</a>). Some other academic projects focus on the capture of metadata (including spatial information) about archaeological surveys, digs, bibliography and more (for example, <a href="http://www.fastionline.org/">Fasti Online</a>, the <a href="http://cgma.depauw.edu/MAGIS/">Mediterranean Archaeological GIS</a>, the <a href="http://www.finds.org.uk">Portable Antiquities Scheme</a>, the <a href="http://tayproject.org/">TAY Project: Archaeological Settlements of Turkey</a>, and some of the vast array of projects cataloged by the <a href="http://www.ecai.org">Electronic Cultural Atlas Initiative</a> over the last decade).<br><br>Then there are the folks building teaching and reference datasets (e.g., <a href="http://bbs.keyhole.com/ubb/showflat.php?Cat=0&amp;Board=EarthHistory&amp;Number=425243&amp;Searchpage=1&amp;Main=425243&amp;Words=+scaife&amp;topic=&amp;Search=true#Post425243">Ross Scaife's Bronze Age Crete KML</a> for Google Earth), as well as those developing regional gazetteers for academic purposes (I just noticed Bill Caraher's mention of his plans to co-author with David Pettegrew <a href="http://mediterraneanworld.typepad.com/the_archaeology_of_the_me/2008/01/archaeology-pos.html">a gazeteer of the Eastern Corinthia</a> -- hint: search in page for "gazetteer").<br><br>If I were going to try to gather some information about projects creating academic historical "gazetteers" or "geographic datasets" (focused on "ancient" times), what questions should I be asking? Should your project be listed?<br><br>If you have thoughts on this, please post a comment or a blog post linking back to this one.</p></body></html>
