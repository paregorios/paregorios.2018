<html><body><a href="http://www.glue.umd.edu/%7Esschreib/">Susan Schriebman</a> and Ann Hanlon have <a href="http://www.stoa.org/?p=762">put together a survey</a> that aims to redress the current lack of a "concerted effort to gather information about the perceived value of tool development, not only as a scholarly activity, but in relation to the tenure and promotion process, as well as for the advancement of the field of digital humanities itself."<br><br>This must be the meme of the month, as <a href="http://history.uwo.ca/faculty/turkel/">Bill Turkel</a> just this week <a href="http://digitalhistoryhacks.blogspot.com/2008_01_14_digitalhistoryhacks_archive.html">unveiled plans</a> to co-author with<a href="http://history.uwo.ca/faculty/maceachern/"> Alan MacEachern</a> a "book to teach practicing historians how to use programming to augment their ability to do research online."<br><br>Anyway, I'd encourage everybody who's ever built a digital tool for a humanities function (or who is thinking about it) to <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=zSMZSh1d3gltcmf6fkfd2g_3d_3d">take the survey</a> and pester Bill to finish the book.</body></html>
