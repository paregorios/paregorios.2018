<html><body><p>I've known about <a href="http://hestieia.wordpress.com/about/">Alexandra Trachsel</a>'s project on <a href="http://hestieia.wordpress.com/biographical-details-about-demetrios/">Demetrios of Skepsis</a> for some time (we hope <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/">Pleiades</a> will provide the raw data for maps she'll need), but it was only today that I stumbled across (by way of a link report for Pleiades from <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/siteoverview">Google's Webmaster Tools</a>) her <a href="http://hestieia.wordpress.com/" title="Alexandra Trachsel's Traveling with Demetrios of Skepsis">interesting blog</a>. One finds more there than meta for her project, especially interesting thoughts and reactions to new trends and reports in digital publishing and digital humanities research.</p></body></html>
