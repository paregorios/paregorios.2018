<html><body><a href="http://zcologia.com/sgillies/">Sean</a> deserves a big hand, and a break: he's just released <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Shapely">Shapely 1.0</a>.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">What:</span><br><br>It's a package of <a href="http://www.python.org/">python</a> code for manipulating and analyzing two-dimensional geospatial geometries. Shapely lets you calculate unions, intersections and differences of two-dimensional shapes, thereby letting you determine whether these shapes intersect, touch or contain one another.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Who:</span><br><br>Sean had alot of great help (see <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Shapely#credits">Shapely Credits</a>). Some of Sean's work on Shapely was supported by our <a href="http://www.neh.gov">NEH</a> grant for <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org">Pleiades</a>.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why:</span><br><br>Why would humanists care about (or help fund) such a code library?<br><br>I'll give you the Pleiad-o-centric part of the answer:  information discovery is an essential component of humanities research, and geography is often highly relevant. What's near what? What's within something else? Or within a certain distance of something else? Are there Roman-era weapon finds cataloged by the <a href="http://www.finds.org.uk/">Portable Antiquities Scheme</a> that fall within 2km of a Roman-era fort registered by Pleiades? Are there excavations documented by <a href="http://www.fastionline.org/">Fasti Online</a> or regional surveys cataloged by <a href="http://cgma.depauw.edu/MAGIS/">MAGIS</a> that correlate with features cataloged in Pleiades? (If so, dynamically provide Pleiades users with links to them as they browse).<br><br>Shapely gives us what we didn't have: a tested, free, open-source, pythonic base for building these kinds of correlation functions and cross-project interoperability calculations into Pleiades and, hopefully, helping others do the same.</body></html>
