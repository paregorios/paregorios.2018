You have a bunch of really big files that you need to transfer to a remote server so collaborators can get at them. You know that upload speed at your location is throttled pretty aggressively (<a href="http://www.meetataromas.com/">my usual haunt</a> has Bell South DSL, and I've never seen a big upload average higher than 48Kbps).
