<html><body><p>For those who didn't have a chance to participate in one of initial <a href="http://projectbamboo.org">Project Bamboo</a> workshops, or who haven't had an opportunity to catch up with what's going on now in that context, I thought I might provide a pointer to the <a href="http://wikibamboo.uchicago.edu/display/BPUB/Home">Project Bamboo Planning Wiki</a>.<br><br>One current activity there is an attempt to <a href="http://wikibamboo.uchicago.edu/display/BPUB/Identify+Themes">Identify Themes of Arts and Humanities Scholarly Practice</a>. My feed reader tells me that there's only one actual theme defined in this new section (just a bit ago), but I bet there will be more soon. The sole present one was offered by <a href="http://www2.ku.edu/%7Ekuanth/people/faculty_hanson.shtml">F. Allan Hanson</a> (U. of Kansas, Anthropology):<br></p><ul><li><a href="http://wikibamboo.uchicago.edu/display/BPUB/Ground+of+Research">Ground of Research</a>: "Humanities research is changing (or will change, or should change) from being grounded in texts (bibliographies) to relational databases."</li></ul>I bet my legions of gentle readers have some opinions about this assertion. Feel free to comment in the comments, or on your blog, or on a public list ... or in the Bamboo Planning Wiki itself.</body></html>
