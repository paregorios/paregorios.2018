<html><body><a href="http://www.archaeogeek.com/blog/2008/08/14/whats-going-on/">Jo Cook</a> is not the only one who didn't like my experiment with including comment and list archive feeds in the <a href="http://planet.atlantides.org/maia">Maia</a> and <a href="http://planet.atlantides.org/electra">Electra</a> aggregators. I don't like it either. They're out.<br><br>Meanwhile, <a href="http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/">BMCR</a> has started producing a blog version of their reviews. It puts out a feed that properly handles the pubdate element. I've added that feed to Maia (see <a href="http://horothesia.blogspot.com/2008/08/bmcr-and-safe-events-feeds-pulled-from.html">earlier comments on the direct BMCR feed</a>). Thanks to Camilla MacKay for the notice.</body></html>
