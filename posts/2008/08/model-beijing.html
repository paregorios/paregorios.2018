<html><body><p>I was psyched to learn, through this morning's <span style="font-style: italic;">Huntsville Times</span>, that the <a href="http://www.aegistg.com/Simulation_Development.htm">simulation development group</a> at my old employer, <a href="http://www.aegistg.com/">AEgis Technologies Group</a>, is getting their <a href="http://www.al.com/news/huntsvilletimes/index.ssf?/base/news/1218186946288430.xml&amp;coll=1">3D modeling work showcased on NBC's Olympics coverage</a>. I had a chance to get the guided tour last year; they're doing some great work, using a combination of sharp people, innovative methods, DigitalGlobe (and other) imagery and open-source software.<br><br>They've set up a demo site where you can find out more and play with some of the models: <a href="http://www.digitalglobe-aegistg.com/">Virtual Beijing of Olympic Proportions</a>.<br><br>I do have to correct one what must be a blunder in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Huntsville Times'</span> write up: the images used cannot all be free ... it's the software they're using that's open-source. Or maybe the confusion is over the difference between "freely available" (i.e., not classified) and "free" (as in better than cheap).</p></body></html>
