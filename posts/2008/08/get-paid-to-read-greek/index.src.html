<html><body><p>From Greg Crane:<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Contribute to the Greek and Latin <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treebank">Treebanks</a>!</span><br><br>We are currently looking for advanced students of Greek and Latin to contribute syntactic analyses (via a web-based system) to our existing Latin Treebank (described below) and our emerging Greek Treebank as well (for which we have just received funding). We particularly encourage students at various levels to design research projects around this new tool. We are looking in particular for the following:<br></p><ul><li>Get paid to read Greek! We can have a limited number of research assistantships for advanced students of the languages who can work for the project from their home institutions. We particularly encourage students who can use the analyses that they produce to support research projects of their own.</li><li>We also encourage classes of Greek and Latin to contribute as well. Creating the syntactic analyses provides a new way to address the traditional task of parsing Greek and Latin. Your class work can then contribute to a foundational new resource for the study of Greek and Latin - both courses as a whole and individual contributors are acknowledged in the published data.</li><li>Students and faculty interested in conducting their own original research based on treebank data will have the option to submit their work for editorial review to have it published as part of the emerging Scaife Digital Library.<br></li></ul>To contribute, please contact David Bamman (<a href="mailto:david.bamman@tufts.edu">david.bamman@tufts.edu</a>) or Gregory Crane (<a href="mailto:gregory.crane@tufts.edu">gregory.crane@tufts.edu</a>).<br><br>For more information, see <a href="http://nlp.perseus.tufts.edu/syntax/treebank/">http://nlp.perseus.tufts.edu/syntax/treebank/</a>.</body></html>
