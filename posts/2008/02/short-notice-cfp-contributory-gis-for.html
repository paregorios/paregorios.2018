Established examples include wikipedia, facebook, and flickr.  More recently applications for sharing geographic information have emerged, such as GoogleEarth and its companion Wikimapia, providing an unprecedented opportunity for historical researchers to collaborate on reconstructing past geographies.  But how trustworthy are these burgeoning websites?  Is the shared information accurate, in standard formats, well documented, or peer reviewed?  To be a viable tool in support of academic research these concerns must be addressed.<br><br>This session seeks speakers who have successfully adopted contributory GIS tools in support of their historical research or teaching.   Topics may include, but are not limited to:<br><ol><li>Projects utilizing contributory Historical GIS</li><li>Accuracy of geographic representations</li><li>Trustworthiness of shared data</li><li>Data standards solutions</li><li>Authenticating archival source material</li><li>Peer review/moderator solutions</li><li>Dealing with inferences</li><li>Privacy &amp; security issues</li><li>Data contributor diparities (e.g., amateurs, geographers, historians, etc.)</li></ol>NOTE: Applications for Graduate Student travel awards are due February 1, 2008 (<a href="http://ssha.org/conference/travel-grant">http://ssha.org/conference/travel-grant</a>)<br><br>Mary B.
