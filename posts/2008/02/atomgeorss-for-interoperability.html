The occasion is a meeting at the British School in Rome, organized by the <a href="http://ircyr.kcl.ac.uk/">Inscriptions of Roman Cyrenaica</a> project, to bring together scholars working in Cyrenaica to explore the potential for cross-project collaboration and data sharing. I used our work so far on  <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org">Pleiades</a> (and a bunch of <a href="http://zcologia.com/sgillies/">Sean</a>'s ideas exchanged on IRC) as a spring-board for a methodological proposal: using Atom+GeoRSS feeds to facilitate cross-project data discovery and citation.<br><br>There will be more about this in future posts, but for now, the slides (mostly screen shots) are available:<br></p><ul><br><li><a href="http://homepages.nyu.edu/~te20/files/ir-cyr-rome-2008/elliott-ir-cyr-rome2008.odp.zip">Tom Elliott: Atom+GeoRSS for Interoperability (<abbr title="Open Document Presentation">ODP</abbr> zipped)</a></li><br><li><a href="http://homepages.nyu.edu/~te20/files/ir-cyr-rome-2008/elliott-ir-cyr-rome2008.ppt.zip"></a>Tom Elliott: Atom+GeoRSS for Interoperability (<abbr title="Powerpoint">PPT</abbr> zipped)</li></ul></body></html>
