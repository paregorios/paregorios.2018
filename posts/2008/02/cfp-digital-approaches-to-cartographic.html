The Work­shop will offer a common ground to colleagues from various disciplines and practice where they can meet, interact and exchange knowledge, experience, plans and ideas on how the digital revolution and modern information and communication technologies in general can or could be used and contribute to cartographic heritage in terms of acquisition, processing visualization and communication of relevant digital data.<br><br>Sessions: The sessions will basically follow the ICA Commission’s terms of reference:<br><ul><li>Introduce and establish the concept of "cartographic heritage". The multidisciplinary dimension of cartographic heritage.  </li><li>Transformation into digital form of old maps, globes and other cartographic documents. Comparison of digitization methods and technologies and development of relevant standards.</li><li>Applications of digital techniques to the cartographic study (analysis and interpretation) of old maps and their geometric and thematic content. Tests of various analytic processes and visualization.</li><li>Development and management of digital map libraries accessible to the general public. Digital tools to assist map curators, to aid the networking of map libraries and to allow in-situ and remote virtual access to cartographic heritage.</li><li>Digital support for the preservation and restoration of old maps, atlases and globes.</li><li>The use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and the web for the teaching and for the diffusion of the heritage of cartography and maps to the general public.</li><li>The ‘digital needs’ of individual map collectors.</li></ul>Papers: The papers, not exceeding 5.000 words, should be e-mailed by <span style="font-weight: bold;">April 10</span> for inclusion in the Workshop’s CD-ROM, which will be available to all participants.<br><br>Proceedings: The presented papers will be published in the proceedings of the Workshop. Some of the papers in a shorter version will be also published in the international web journal on sciences and technologies affined to history of cartography and maps <a href="http://www.e-perimetron.org/">e-Perimetron</a> [ISSN 1790-3769] following the journal’s editorial policy.<br><br>Language:  The presentations will be given in English as well as the papers sent for inclusion in the Workshop’s CD-ROM and in the Proceedings.
