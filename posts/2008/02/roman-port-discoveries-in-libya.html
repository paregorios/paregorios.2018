<html><body><a href="http://www.atrium-media.com/rogueclassicism/Posts/00007538.html">By way of rogueclassicism</a> I found out about a brief notice from ANSA entitled "<a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.ansa.it/opencms/export/site/notizie/rubriche/daassociare/visualizza_new.html_13430248.html">Scoperti due antichi porti romani in Libia</a>".  <a href="http://newscontrol.repubblica.it/item/417754/archeologia-scoperti-2-porti-romani-in-cirenaica-libia">A slightly longer piece in <span style="font-style: italic;">La Repubblica</span></a> repeats the "hitherto unknown" assertion. <span style="font-style: italic;">Sicilia Informazioni</span> provides a longer and clearer report on the same information under the title "<a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.siciliainformazioni.com/giornale/cultura/9650/scoperto-porto-romano-nelle-coste-della-libia.htm">Ritrovato un porto romano sulle coste della Libia</a>".<br><br>I found the piece a bit odd, since it claimed the "discovery" of a Roman port at <a href="http://homepages.nyu.edu/%7Ete20/kml/hamama.kml">Hamama in Libya</a> (kml) that "might be" the <span style="font-style: italic;">Phykous</span> (Greek: <span lang="grc">Φυκοῦς</span>) mentioned by Strabo (17.3.20) and Ptolemy (4.4.5; Latin: <span style="font-style: italic;" lang="la">Phycus</span>) ... and yet the <span style="font-style: italic;">Barrington Atlas</span> (and after it, <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/">Pleiades</a>) have no hesitation in <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/373872">placing <span style="font-style: italic;">Phykous</span></a> at that very spot. If there were some significant doubt about the siting of a named, attested place, we would have expected the Atlas to indicate such.<br><br>A little digging reveals that this inconsistency is probably an accident of editing in the media reports of recent archaeological work. The press release that seems to be behind these stories is posted on the website of the <a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.regione.sicilia.it/beniculturali/archeologiasottomarina/sez_eventi/libia_2008.htm">Soprintendenza del Mare, Regione Siciliana</a> (one of the partners in the expedition).  This report acknowledges that the site of <span style="font-style: italic;">Phykous</span> (mod. Hamama) has been well-known for some decades, but notes that it have never previously been subjected to systematic survey. Indeed, <span style="font-style: italic;">BAtlas</span> cites G.D.B.
