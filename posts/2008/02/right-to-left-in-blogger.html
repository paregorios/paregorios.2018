<html><body><p>Last week, <a href="http://horothesia.blogspot.com/2008/01/growing-pains-at-bp3.html#gripe-rtl">I griped about blogger's announcement of right-to-left text support</a> because the post seemed to say that a point-and-click mechanism for mixing right-to-left and left-to-right text was only available in blogs set to the newly available Arabic, Hebrew or Persian languages.<br><br>I got a comment to the effect that I was wrong and that the settings are available in the dashboard. After an inspection of the dashboard for this blog, and of every single customization tab, I conclude that I was not wrong.<br><br>You can only get compose-gui support for mixing RTL and LTR in posts if your blog language is set to Arabic, Hebrew or Persian. <a href="http://help.blogger.com/bin/answer.py?answer=82229&amp;topic=12457">The relevant blogger help entry</a> confirms this view (emphasis mine):<br></p><blockquote>If you're not seeing the directionality buttons in the post editor, it's likely because <span style="font-weight: bold;">right-to-left support is only available in the Hebrew, Arabic and Persian interfaces.</span></blockquote>I stand by my original complaints.<br></body></html>
