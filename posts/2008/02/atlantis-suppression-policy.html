<html><body><p>This applies to all aggregators available at <a href="http://planet.atlantides.org">planet.atlantides.org</a>. <br><br>Henceforth, I'll be suppressing any and all feeds with futuristic datestamps that cause future-dated entries to hover at the top of the aggregator results ahead of truly new content on other blogs. I'll revisit such suppression decisions on a more-or-less monthly basis. <br><br>So, if your posts are not getting dated right in your feeds, or if you have an event feed that stamps entries with dates for the event (rather than when the notice is published), you will likely see your feed content dropped from the aggregators. If you fix your blog feeds to take care of such a problem, please drop me an email and I'll reinstate the feed.<br><br>I may apply a similar policy to feeds that frequently redate-to-present multiple past posts in which there's no obvious update of content.</p></body></html>
