<html><body><p>A diverse and interesting crowd of folks is pounding down coffee and putting on blue-collared shirts this morning to prepare to participate in the first conference organized by the <a href="http://dca.drupalgardens.com/">Digital Classics Association</a>. It's called "<a href="http://classics.buffalo.edu/events/dcaconference/">Word, Space, Time: Digital Perscpectives on the Classical World</a>" and runs today and tomorrow (5-6 April 2013) in the Center for the Arts Screening Room at the University of Buffalo. On-site registration is available, so come on out!<br><br><a href="http://classics.buffalo.edu/events/dcaconference/program.shtml">Here's the conference program</a>.<br><br>There's already broad consensus that we'll use the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23dca2013">#dca2013</a> hashtag for tweets about the event. If you're blogging or otherwise serializing or critiquing the conference online and your platform is feed-equipped, please let me know and I'll make sure it's in the subscription list for the <a href="http://planet.atlantides.org/maia/">Maia Atlantis feed aggregator</a> so it gets wider exposure.<br><br>I've also initiated an IRC channel on the freenode network to support backchannel communications: #dca2013.<br><br>Here's hoping for robust wifi at the venue...<br><br>See you at the conference or online!</p></body></html>
