Accordingly, our Senior Digital Humanities Web Developer/Architects envision, create, and curate web applications that bridge gaps in content and function while handling the diversity of languages, scripts, geography, chronology, and methodology inherent in the study of the past-oriented humanities. You carry out this mission in constant, productive collaboration with scholars, students, and enthusiasts from both inside and outside the Institute, empowering them as co-creators, curators, and users.</blockquote><br>Position description and application instructions may be found online at: <a href="http://www.nyucareers.com/applicants/Central?quickFind=57339">http://www.nyucareers.com/applicants/Central?quickFind=57339</a></body></html>
