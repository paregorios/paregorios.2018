<html><body><p>At the request of one of its authors, I have removed the subscription to the <a href="https://resgerendae.wordpress.com/"><i>Res gerendae</i> blog</a> from the <a href="http://planet.atlantides.org/maia/"><i>Maia Atlantis</i> feed aggregator</a>. Users of <i>Maia</i> who are interested in content from <i>Res gerendae</i> will now have to follow the blog directly, as its content will no longer be syndicated in the aggregator.</p></body></html>
