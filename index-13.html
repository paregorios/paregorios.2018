    <p>The subscription list for <a href="http://planet.atlantides.org/maia/">Maia Atlantis</a> is getting pretty huge. In <a href="http://mediterraneanworld.typepad.com/the_archaeology_of_the_me/2008/08/metadata-monday.html">a recent post</a>, Bill Caraher reminded me that there's a big (and growing) genre of excavation blogs. I think this genre is heavily underrepresented in the <a href="http://planet.atlantides.org">Atlantides feed aggregator constellation</a>.<br><br>It occurred to me that it might be worthwhile to put dig-specific blogs into their own aggregator, and pull the few currently in Maia out and put them there too.<br><br>On the up side, that might help keep Maia to a manageable size. On the down side it would mean splitting up what has, until now, been a one-stop shop for ancient world blog content. And there would inevitably be some blogs in which lots of interesting non-excavation posts appear alongside hard-core dig news and status.<br><br>Thoughts?</p>

    <p>It is with regret that this morning I have pulled the <a href="http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/">Bryn Mawr Classical Review</a> (BMCR) <a href="http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/recent.xml">Most Recent Articles feed</a> from the list of feeds aggregated by <a href="http://planet.atlantides.org/maia/">Maia Atlantis</a>. I took this step in accordance with my own <a href="http://horothesia.blogspot.com/2008/02/atlantis-suppression-policy.html">Atlantis Suppression Policy</a>.<br><br>It would appear that every time the BMCR adds a new article, dates on all articles in the feed are updated to present. As of this writing every single entry contains an identical "pubdate" tag with the value "03:49:18, Sunday, 03 August 2008" even though some of the entries have been in the list since it was first deployed <a href="http://horothesia.blogspot.com/2008/07/prayer-answered-bmcr-gets-feed.html">a few weeks ago</a>. This is non-standard behavior, and has the effect of pushing all the BMCR entries, in a block, to the top of any feed reader or aggregator, ahead of other content that is actually new. And in most feed readers they will show up highlighted or bolded, to indicate "new content."  The appropriate behavior is to adjust dates only on those entries that have been added or substantially changed.<br><br>The <a href="http://www.savingantiquities.org/">Saving Antiquities for Everyone</a> (SAFE) <a href="http://www.savingantiquities.org/makefeed_events.php">Events Feed</a> is also  blocked because it is  forward-dating announcements of events to the date of the event, rather than the date of the entry. For example, the current feed contains a single entry with the following pubdate: "Thu, 16 Oct 2008 07:00:00 EST". This is the event date, not the publication date of the feed entry. This is also abuse of feed entry date fields and has the effect of causing these entries to linger at the top of the aggregation list for weeks or months until the date of the event passes.<br><br>I will be contacting the editors of both resources in the hopes of resolving these technical difficulties so that their content can once again be featured in <span style="font-style: italic;">Maia Atlantis</span>.</p>

    <p>There's been <a href="http://mblog.lib.umich.edu/blt/archives/2008/07/google_still_no.html">a bit of buzz lately</a> about Google's "failure" to effectively search the "hidden (deep) web". In the discussions I've been seeing, the hidden web is equated with stuff in academic and digital library repositories, i.e., "<a href="http://www.openarchives.org/">OAI</a>-based resources" (which I assume to mean <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/pmh/">OAI/PMH</a>).<br><br>I have to say: repositories != hidden web. The hidden web is simply the stuff the search engines don't find. Systems that surface information about their content only through OAI/PMH interfaces might <span style="font-style: italic;">make up a small part</span> of the hidden web because they're not being surfaced to the bots, but frankly the hidden web holds way more stuff than what's in Fedora and DSpace at universities. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Web">Just ask Wikipedia</a>.<br><br>The assertion that repository content == the hidden web is circular and false rhetoric that obscures the real problem: people are fighting the web instead of working with it. If you fight it, it will ignore you. This sort of thinking also makes hay for enterprises like the <a href="http://www.isen.org/">Internet Search Environment Number</a> that seem to me to be trying to carve out business models that exploit, perpetuate and promote the cloistering of content and the rationing of information discovery.<br><br>Yesterday, Peter Millington posted what's effectively the antidote on the <a href="http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=JISC-REPOSITORIES">JISC-REPOSITORIES</a> list (cross-posted to other lists). I reproduce it here in full because it's good advice not just for repositories but for anybody who is putting complex collections of content on the web and wants that content to be discoverable and useful:<br></p>

Here are seven common gotchas spotted by SHERPA:<br><ol>
<li>Require all visitors to have a username and password</li>
<li>Do not have a 'Browse' interface with hyperlinks between pages</li>
<li>Set a 'robots.txt' file and/or use 'robots' meta tags in HTML headers that prevent search engine crawling</li>
<li>Restrict access to embargoed and/or other (selected) full texts</li>
<li>Accept poor quality or restrictive PDF files</li>
<li>Hide your OAI Base URL</li>
<li>Have awkward URLs </li>

One of the things we like most about it is that its primary serialization format is <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287">Atom</a>, which is already indexed by the big search engines.

    <p>I wanted to blog about this as soon as it hit my feedreader, but then there was that proposal to finish. Anyway:<br><br>One of the highlights of a decade spent at <a href="http://www.unc.edu/">Carolina</a> was getting to work with <a href="http://wwwx.cs.unc.edu/%7Egb/wp/">Gary Bishop</a>, a professor in the Department of Computer Science. We found ourselves in <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/Research/assist/bats/">a collaboration initiated by Jason Morris</a>, a blind Classics graduate student who was deeply interested in ancient geography and for whom Braille maps constituted a ridiculously low-bandwidth, low-resolution disappointment. The idea of producing immersive spatial audio maps took off in the hands of a group of Gary's undergraduate students and, with some seed money from <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Research</a>, this one initiative blossomed into a <a href="http://wwwx.cs.unc.edu/%7Egb/wp/research/">research</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/Research/assist/et/2006/">teaching</a> program in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistive_technology">assistive technology</a>.<br><br>Gary's recently blogged about a cool new project: the <a href="http://wwwx.cs.unc.edu/%7Egb/wp/blog/2008/07/27/outfox-speech-sound-and-more-for-firefox/">Outfox extension for Firefox</a>, which:<br></p>
<blockquote>allows in-page JavaScript to access local platform services and devices such as text-to-speech synthesis, sound playback and game controllers</blockquote>It's open source (BSD License), and you can help.<br><blockquote></blockquote>
