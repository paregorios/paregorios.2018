Thirty-one leading academics, developers, and higher-ed administrators serve on the faculty and advisory board of the Institute.<br><br>The National Endowment for the Humanities will support travel, working meals, and lodging for 40 attendees as well as Institute faculty members. Special funding is available for graduate students. The University of Virginia Library will also fund up to 5 short-term scholar- and developer-in-residencies at the Scholars' Lab to complement the Institute's focus on humanities GIS.<br><br>Three four-day Institute tracks are planned:<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">15-18 November 2009: </span><br>Track 1: Stewardship (for library, museum, GIS and digital humanities center professionals)<br>Track 2: Software (for Web developers, designers, systems administrators, and information scientists)<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">25-28 May 2010:</span><br>Track 3: Scholarship (for humanities scholars, advanced graduate students, and post-docs)<br><br>Application DEADLINES are September 1st (for Tracks 1 and 2) and December 1st (for Track 3).  Special consideration will be given to those who apply as part of an institutional team, as the curriculum is designed to foster robust technical and social infrastructure, at a local level, for geospatial scholarship in the digital humanities.<br><br>Apply to attend at the URL above, and please help distribute this message widely!</blockquote>

    <span style="font-style: italic;">Determinatio</span> is a Latin term (Greek: á¼ÏÎ¿ÏÎ¹ÏÎ¼á½¹Ï or á½ÏÎ¿Î¸á½³ÏÎ¹Î±) for the written, serial description of boundaries, produced as necessary by Roman surveyors and routinely included in the verdicts of Roman (pro-)magistrates and <span style="font-style: italic;">iudices</span> when settling boundary disputes.<br><br>Here's an example, dating to the early second century CE:<br><br>Serving as proconsul of either Achaia or Macedonia, <a href="http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/sentius_augurinusx.html">Q.

Stolper<br>Professor of Assyriology, John A. Wilson Professor of Oriental Studies in the Oriental Institute, The University of Chicago<br><br>Matthew W. Stolper is the Director of the Persepolis Fortification Archive Project. In 1933, Oriental Institute archaeologists working at Persepolis, clearing the ruined palaces of Kings Darius, Xerxes, and their Achaemenid Persian successors, found tens of thousands of clay tablets in a bastion in the fortification wall at the edge of the great stone terrace. These documents were pieces of a single, complex system, the Persepolis Fortification Archive, that proved-after decades of painstaking work-to be the largest and most important single source of information from within the Persian Empire on Achaemenid Persian languages, history, society, religion and art. Now, the Archive faces a legal battle that could well lead to its dismemberment and loss if it is seized and sold, and disappears into the holdings of private collectors around the world. Fueled by this crisis the Persepolis Fortification Archive Project is a new phase in recording and distributing the results of the study of the archive, responding to emergency conditions with electronic equipment and media alongside the conventional tool-kits of philology and scholarship.<br><br>A summary of the project is available on the website of the Oriental Institute (<a href="http://oi.uchicago.edu/research/projects/pfa/">http://oi.uchicago.edu/research/projects/pfa/</a>).<br><br>Background and news of the project and the controversy are available at the Persepolis Fortification Archive Weblog (<a href="http://persepolistablets.blogspot.com/">http://persepolistablets.blogspot.com/</a>).<br><br>This lecture is free and open to the public, but please be sure to <a href="mailto:isawevents@nyu.edu">RSVP</a>.

    <strong>Two Public Lectures on Publishing Archaeological Data on the Web</strong><br><br><strong><a href="http://sebastianheath.com/">Sebastian Heath</a>, Ph.D. (American Numismatic Society)</strong><br><strong><a href="http://isd.ischool.berkeley.edu/person/ekansa">Eric Kansa</a>, Ph.D. (University of California, Berkeley)</strong><br><br>Date: 14 April 2009<br>Time: 7:30 p.m.<br>Location: <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/isaw/">Institute for the Study of the Ancient World</a>, 15 E 84th St., New York, NYÂ  10028, U.S.A. (lecture room)<br><br><strong>Heath: Digital Publication and Linked Data at Troy</strong><br><br>The Post-Bronze Age Excavations at Troy in Turkey, known as Ilion in the Greek and Roman periods, have begun a program of publishing ceramic vessels and coins from the site in digital format. Our goal is to provide the information in formats that are useful to archaeologists in the field and to students or anybody else interested in this material. Accordingly, all the files that make up these publications are available for download under Creative Commons licenses. Anybody can take this information and redistribute it for free. We are also working to express the inherent links within archaeological information. A user reading about pottery from North Africa found at Troy can easily link to secondary literature and internet resources that will increase their understanding of this material. We likewise hope to make such links discoverable by search engines as well as by researchers working on the digital processing of humanities resources.<br><br><strong>Kansa: Open Context: Digital Dissemination of Field Research and Museum Collections</strong><br><br>Publishing archaeological field data and primary documentation has received increasing attention and concern. Archaeological sites are threatened and archaeological methods themselves are often destructive. Often, excavation and survey records represent the only aspect of the archaeological record that can be preserved. This is especially worrisome, since so much of this documentation is in vulnerable, volatile digital formats. In addition to cultural heritage preservation issues, archaeologists often want to use pooled primary field documentation as a resource for investigation. Research may be enhanced by simplifying and speeding access to such documentation, or even by comparing across the results of multiple studies.<br><br>In an attempt to respond to these needs, several initiatives are exploring several approaches toward digital dissemination. Open Context (<a href="http://www.opencontext.org/">http://www.opencontext.org</a>) is an open source system that provides a cost-effective dissemination solution for field research and museum collections. The system offers integrated access and services across datasets pooled from multiple research projects and collections. A long-term development goal is to help link field research and museum collections with active discussions and creative reuses, making these collections a much richer and integral part of continued cultural and scholarly production. Citation features and editorial control encourage researchers to consider publication in Open Context as a valid form of scholarly communication. At the same time, Creative Commons licenses give explicit permissions for users to freely and legally use the material so long as they properly attribute the original creator and abide by a few other optional terms.<br><br>A major challenge with Open Contextâs approach lies in data integration and mapping different source data sets to Open Contextâs common global structure. Open Context aims to provide Web-based tool for researchers and collections managers to upload, "markup" and publish diverse archaeological and museum collection datasets. It remains to be seen if this tool can be easy enough to use by individual contributors, or if trained staff will always be required to aid such markup.<strong> <br></strong>

    <p>By way of Lawrence Summers' post to the MapHist list, I just learned of the following <a href="http://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2009/09-030.html">public lecture, to be given by John Hessler at the Library of Congress</a> on the 25th of February, 2009:<br></p>
<blockquote>John W. Hessler, a senior reference librarian in the Geography and Map Division of the Library of Congress and fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, will present "In the Footsteps of Caesar: Searching for the Physical and Epigraphical Remains of Roman Centuriation and Surveying in Tunisia" at noon on Wednesday, Feb. 25. The lecture will be held in the Geography and Map Reading Room, in the basement level of the James Madison Building, 101 Independence Ave. S.E., Washington, D.C.<br><br>Sponsored by the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/rr/geogmap/">Geography and Map Division</a>, the event is free and open to the public; tickets and reservations are not required. The lecture is part of the division's "Map Talk" series.<br><br>In his lecture, Hessler will provide a brief description of the cartography and surveying techniques employed by the Romans in North Africa; a description of a sixth-century manuscript known as "Corpus Agrimensorum," which spells out how the Romans surveyed their territories; and a travel log describing his search for the physical remains of Roman surveying practices in Tunisia and Southern France.</blockquote>
