<blockquote>The absence of the latest newsletter from the <a href="http://www.csad.ox.ac.uk/BES/"><abbr title="British Epigraphy Society">BES</abbr> website</a> is deliberate — only [listserv] subscribers get the cutting-edge news!</blockquote>Why on earth would a professional academic organization with a web presence and a mission statement thereon that contains the following words limit themselves in this way?:<br><blockquote>to promote the study of inscriptions, texts and historical documents ... disseminating news of the latest developments in epigraphic studies, in Britain and around the world<br>
</blockquote>Or is the real issue that "subscribers" = "members" and timely access to the newsletter is seen by the Society as an exclusive benefit of membership?

    <p>The above quote is attributed to Gwendolyn Bradley, of the American Association of University Professors, in this morning's issue of <span style="font-style: italic;">Inside Higher Education</span> where Scott Jaschik writes about a "<a href="http://insidehighered.com/news/2008/09/11/adjunct">New Form of Adjunct Abuse</a>":<br></p>
<blockquote>At San Antonio College ... adjuncts are being encouraged to take on extra courses, ... [but] the college is asking some part timers ... to agree in writing to pretend that they aren’t teaching 12 credits. ...<br><br>Gerald J. Davey, an adjunct at San Antonio College who has served as the adjunct representative on the Faculty Council there, did not sign a waiver, but he has spoken with those who have and is angry about the system being used. Davey said that, in years past, once an adjunct has had a contract for 12 credits, benefits and higher pay scales have kicked in — and that the waivers are an attempt to limit what adjuncts receive from the college.</blockquote>Aside:<br><br>I can't help but draw attention to this most unfortunate of "context-sensitive" advertisements that appeared alongside Jaschik's story:<br><br><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tcSZVmUJxp0/SMkgiHp7IPI/AAAAAAAAABQ/XlryJ1sge50/s1600-h/adjunctabuse.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: none; cursor: pointer;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tcSZVmUJxp0/SMkgiHp7IPI/AAAAAAAAABQ/XlryJ1sge50/s320/adjunctabuse.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5244759011592184050" border="0"></a>
