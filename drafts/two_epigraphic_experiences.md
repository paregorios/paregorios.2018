I've recently experienced two presentations of Roman inscriptions that were previously unknown to me. The first involves inscriptions from the Roman military camp and associated facilities at [modern Heidelberg, Germany](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/118731). The second involves inscriptions from the area around [ancient Thugga (modern Dougga in Tunisia)](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/315223). Both of these inscriptions, as presented in the venues I experienced, illustrate the emergence of complex multi-media and multi-sourced epigraphic publications we've been hoping for.
